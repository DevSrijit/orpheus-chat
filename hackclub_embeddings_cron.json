        "content": "The AI debate is actually 100 debates in a trenchcoat.\nWill artificial intelligence (AI) help us cure all disease, and build a post-scarcity world full of flourishing lives? Or will AI help tyrants surveil and manipulate us further? Are the main risks of AI from accidents, abuse by bad actors, or a rogue AIitselfbecoming a bad actor? Is this all just hype? Why can AI imitate any artist's style in a minute, yet gets confused drawing more than 3 objects? Why is it hard to make AI robustly serve humane values, or robustly serveanygoal? What if an AI learns to bemorehumane than us? What if an AI learns humanity'sinhumanity, our prejudices and cruelty? Are we headed for utopia, dystopia, extinction, a fateworsethan extinction, or — the most shocking outcome of all —nothing changes?Also: will an AI take my job?\n...and many more questions.\nAlas, to understand AI with nuance, we must understand lots of technical detail... but that detail is scattered across hundreds of articles, buried six-feet-deep in jargon.\nSo, I present to you:\n\nThis 3-part series is your one-stop-shop to understand the core ideas of AI & AI Safety* — explained in a friendly, accessible, and slightly opinionated way!\n(* Related phrases: AI Risk, AI X-Risk, AI Alignment, AI Ethics, AI Not-Kill-Everyone-ism. There isnoconsensus on what these phrases do & don't mean, so I'm just using \"AI Safety\" as a catch-all.)\nThis series will also have comics starring a Robot Catboy Maid. Like so:\n\n[tour guide voice]And to your right 👉, you'll see buttons forthe Table of Contents,changing this webpage's style, anda reading-time-remaining clock.\nFor this series, the Intro & Part 1 were published onMay 2024, Part 2 is out now onAug 2024, and Part Three will be out onDec 2024. OPTIONAL: If you'd like to be notified on their release, signup below!👇 Youwill notbe spammed with other stuff, just the two notification emails. (Buuuuut,[podcast sponsor voice]if you're in high school or earlier, and interested in AI/code/engineering, consider checking the box to learn more aboutHack Club!P.S: There's freestickers~~~✨)\n\nAnyway,[tour guide voice again]before we hike through the rocky terrain of AI & AI Safety, let's take a 10,000-foot look of the land:\nIn my opinion, the main problems in AI and AI Safety come down totwo core conflicts:\n\nNote: What \"Logic\" and \"Intuition\" are will be explained more rigorously in Part One. For now: Logic is step-by-step cognition, like solving math problems. Intuition is all-at-oncerecognition, like seeing if a picture is of a cat. \"Intuition and Logic\" roughly map onto \"System 1 and 2\" from cognitive science.[1][2](👈 hover over these footnotes! they expand!)\nAs you can tell by the \"scare\" \"quotes\" on\"versus\", these divisions ain't really so divided after all...\nHere's how these conflicts repeat over this 3-part series:\nSkipping over alotof detail, the history of AI is a tale ofLogic vs Intuition:\nBefore 2000: AI was all logic, no intuition.\nThis was why, in 1997, AI could beat the world champion at chess... yet no AIs could reliably recognize cats in pictures.[3]\n(Safety concern: Without intuition, AI can't understand common sense or humane values. Thus, AI might achieve goals in logically-correct but undesirable ways.)\nAfter 2000: AI could do \"intuition\", but had very poor logic.\nThis is why generative AIs (as of current writing, May 2024) can dream up whole landscapes in any artist's style...:yet gets confused drawing more than 3 objects.(👈 click this text! it also expands!)\n(Safety concern: Without logic, we can't verify what's happening in an AI's \"intuition\". That intuition could be biased, subtly-but-dangerously wrong, or fail bizarrely in new scenarios.)\nCurrent Day: Westilldon't know how to unify logic & intuition in AI.\nBut if/when we do,thatwould give us the biggest risks & rewards of AI: something that can logically out-plan us,andlearn general intuition. That'd be an \"AI Einstein\"... or an \"AI Oppenheimer\".\nSummed in a picture:\n\nSo that's \"Logic vs Intuition\". As for the other core conflict, \"Problems in the AI vs The Humans\", that's one of the big controversies in the field of AI Safety: are our main risks from advanced AIitself, or fromhumansmisusing advanced AI?\n(Why not both?)\nTheproblem of AI Safety is this:[4]\nThe Value Alignment Problem:“How can we make AI robustly serve humane values?”\nNOTE: I wrotehumane, with an \"e\", not just \"human\". Ahumanmay or may not behumane. I'm going to harp on this becausebothadvocates & critics of AI Safety keep mixing up the two.[5][6]\nWe can break this problem down by \"Problems in Humans vs AI\":\nHumane Values:“Whatarehumane values, anyway?”(a problem for philosophy & ethics)\nTheTechnicalAlignment Problem:“How can we make AI robustly serveany intended goalat all?”(a problem for computer scientists - surprisingly, still unsolved!)\nThetechnicalalignment problem, in turn, can be broken down by \"Logic vs Intuition\":\nProblems with AI Logic:[7](\"game theory\" problems)\nProblems with AI Intuition:[8](\"deep learning\" problems)\n(Again, what \"logic\" and \"intuition\" are will be more precisely explained later!)\nSummed in a picture:\n\nAs intuition for how hard these problems are, note that we haven't even solved themfor us humans— People follow the letter of the law, not the spirit. People's intuition can be biased, and fail in new circumstances. And none of us are 100% the humane humans we wished we were.\nSo, if I may be a bit sappy, maybe understanding AI will help us understand ourselves. And just maybe, we can solve thehumanalignment problem: How do we gethumansto robustly serve humane values?\nFinally, we can understand some (possible) ways to solve the problems in logic, intuition, AIs,andhumans! These include:\n— and more! Experts disagree on which proposals will work, if any... but it's a good start.\n(Unfortunately, I can't give a layperson-friendly summary in this Intro, because these solutions won't make senseuntilyou understand the problems, which is what Part 1 & 2 are for. That said, if you want spoilers,:click here to see what Part 3 will cover!)\nHey, d'ya ever get this feeling?\nTo avoid that forthisguide, I've included someOPTIONALinteractive flashcards! They use \"Spaced Repetition\", an easy-ish, evidence-backed way to \"make long-term memory a choice\". (:click here to learn more about Spaced Repetition!)\nHere:try the below flashcards, to retain what you just learnt!\n(There's an optional sign-up at the end,ifyou want to save these cards for long-term study.

You be the judge if you got it \"close enough\".)\n“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble.\nIt’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.”\n~ often attributed to Mark Twain, but it just ain't so[9]\nFor better and worse, you've already heard too much about AI. So before we connectnewpuzzle pieces in your mind, we gotta take out theoldpieces that just ain't so.\nThus, if you'll indulge me in a \"Top 5\" listicle...\n\nAI Safety / AI Risk used to be less mainstream, but now in 2024, the US & UK governments now have AI Safety-specific departments![10]This resulted from many ofthetop AI researchers raising alarm bells about it. These folks include:\n(To be clear: therearealso top AI researchersagainstfears of AI Risk, such Yann LeCun,[16]co-winner of the 2018 Turing Prize, and chief AI researcher atFacebookMeta. Another notable name is Melanie Mitchell[17], a researcher in AI & complexity science.)\nI'm aware \"look at these experts\" is an appeal to authority, but this isonlyto counter the idea of, \"eh, only sci-fi weebs fear AI Risk\". But in the end, appeal to authority/weebs isn't enough; you have toactually understand the dang thing. (Which youaredoing, by reading this! So thank you.)\nBut speaking of sci-fi weebs...\nSci-fi authors write sentient AIs because they're writingstories, not technical papers. The philosophical debate on artificial consciousness is fascinating,and irrelevant to AI Safety.Analogy: a nuclear bomb isn't conscious, but it can still be unsafe, no?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the real problems in AI Safety are \"boring\": an AI learns the wrong things from its biased training data, it breaks in slightly-new scenarios, it logically accomplishes goals in undesired ways, etc.\nBut, \"boring\" doesn't meannot important. The technical details of how to design a safe elevator/airplane/bridge are boring to most laypeople...and alsoa matter of life-and-death.\n(Catastrophic AI Risk doesn't even require \"super-human general intelligence\"! For example, an AI that's \"only\" good at designing viruses could help a bio-terrorist organization (like Aum Shinrikyo[18]) kill millions of people.)\nBut speaking of killing people...\n\nWhile most AI researchersdobelieve advanced AI poses a 5+% risk of \"literally everybody dies\"[19], it'sveryhard to convince folks (especially policymakers) of stuff that's never happened before.\nSo instead, I'd like to highlight the ways that advanced AI – (especially when it's available to anyone with a high-end computer) – could lead to catastrophes, \"merely\" by scaling upalready-existingbad stuff.\nFor example:\nThe above examples are all \"humansmisuseAI to cause havoc\", but remember advanced AI could do the aboveby itself, due to \"boring\" reasons: it's accomplishing a goal in a logical-but-undesirable way, its goals glitch out but its skills remain intact, etc.\n(Bonus,:Some concrete, plausible ways a rogue AI could \"escape containment\", or affect the physical world.)\nPoint is: even if one doesn't think AI is aliteral 100% human extinctionrisk... I'd say \"homebrew bio-terrorism\" & \"1984 with robots\" are still worth taking seriously.\nOn the flipside...\n\nAI Risk folks aren't Luddites. In fact, they warn about AI's downsidesprecisely becausethey care about AI's upsides.[30]As humorist Gil Stern once said:[31]\n“Both the optimist and the pessimist contribute to society: the optimist invents the airplane, and the pessimist invents the parachute.”\nSo: even as this series goes into detail on how AIis alreadygoing wrong, it's worth remembering the few ways AIis alreadygoing right:\nToo often, we take technology — even life-saving technology — for granted. So, let me zoom out for context. Here's the last 2000+ years of child mortality, the percentage of kids who die before puberty:\n(fromDattani, Spooner, Ritchie and Roser (2023))\nForthousandsof years, in nations both rich and poor, a fullhalfof kids just died. This was a constant. Then, starting in the 1800s — thanks to science/tech like germ theory, sanitation, medicine, clean water, vaccines, etc — child mortality fell off like a cliff. We still have far more to go — I refuse to accept[33]a worldwide 4.3% (1 in 23) child death rate — but let's just appreciate how humanityso swiftly cut downaneons-oldscourge.\nHow did we achieve this? Policy's a big part of the story, but policy is \"the art of the possible\"[34], and the above wouldn't have been possible withoutgoodscience & tech. If safe, humane AI can help us progress further by even just a few percent — towards slaying the remaining dragons of cancer, Alzheimer's, HIV/AIDS, etc — that'd be tens of millions more of our loved ones, who get to beat the Reaper for another day.\nF#@☆ going to Mars,that'swhy advanced AI matters.\n. . .\nWait,really?Toys like ChatGPT and DALL-E arelife-and-deathstakes? That leads us to the final misconception I'd like to address:\nOh come on,one might reasonably retort,AI can't consistently draw more than 3 objects. How's it going to take over the world? Heck, how's it even going to take my job?\nI present to you, arelevant xkcd:\n\nThis is how I feel about \"don't worry about AI, it can't even do [X]\".\nIs our postmodern memory-spanthatbad?Onedecade ago, justone, the world's state-of-the-art AIs couldn't reliablyrecognize pictures of cats.Now, notonlycan AI do that at human-performance level, AIs can pump out:a picture of a cat-ninja slicing a watermelon in the style of Vincent Van Goghinunder a minute.\nIscurrentAI a huge threat to our jobs, or safety? No. (Well, besides the aforementioned deepfake scams.)\nBut: if AI keeps improving at a similar rate as it has for the last decade... it seems plausible to me we could get \"Einstein/Oppenheimer-level\" AI in 30 years.[35]That's well within many folks' lifetimes!\nAs \"they\" say:[36]\nThe best time to plant a tree was 30 years ago. The second best time is today.\nLet's plant that tree today!\n(To review the flashcards, click theTable of Contents icon in the right sidebar, then click the \"🤔 Review\" links.

Now that we've taken the 10,000-foot view, let's get hiking on our whirlwind tour of AI Safety... for us warm, normal, fleshy humans!\nClick to continue ⤵\nPART ONE →\nHi! When I have a tangent that doesn't fit the main flow, I'll shove it into an \"expandable\" section like this one! (They'll be links withdottedunderlines, not solid underlines.)\nAnyway, here's a prompt to draw four objects:\n“A yellow pyramid between a red sphere and green cylinder, all on top of a big blue cube.”\nHere are the top generative AI's first four attempts (notcherry-picked):\nMidjourney:\n\nDALL-E 2:\n\nDALL-E 3:\n\n(The bottom-right one's pretty close! But judging by its other attempts, it's clearly luck.)\nWhy does this demonstrate a lack of \"logic\" in AI? A core part of \"symbolic logic\" is the ability to do \"compositionality\", a fancy way of saying it can reliably combine old things into new things, like \"green\" + \"cylinder\" = \"green cylinder\". As shown above, generative AIs (as of May 2024) areveryunreliable at combining stuff, when there's more than 3 objects.\n~ ~ ~\nAnyway, that's the end of this Nutshell!

But I'm putting this here now, for:\na) The layperson audience, to reassure y'all that, yes, therearemany promising proposed solutions.\nb) The expert audience, to reassure y'all that, yes, I probably have your niche lil' thing in here.\nAnyway, the TOP 10 TYPES-OF-SOLUTIONS to AI Safety: (with the fancy jargon in parentheses)\n“Use it, or lose it.”\nThat's the core principle behind both muscles and brains. (It rhymes, so it must be true!) As decades of educational research robustly show (Dunlosky et al., 2013 [pdf]), if you want to retain something long-term, it's not enough to re-read or highlight stuff: you have to actuallytest yourself.\nThat's why flashcards work so well! But, two problems: 1) It's overwhelming when you havehundredsof cards you want to remember. And 2) It's inefficient to review cards youalreadyknow well.\nSpaced Repetitionsolves both these problems! To see how, let's see what happens if you learn a fact, thendon'treview it. Your memory of it decays over time, until you cross a threshold where you've likely forgotten it:\n\nBut, if you review a factjust beforeyou forget it, you can get your memory-strength back up...and more importantly, your memory of that fact will decayslower!\n\nSo, with Spaced Repetition, we review right before you're predicted to forget a card, over and over. As you can see, the reviews get more and more spread out:\n\nThis is what makes Spaced Repetition so efficient!Every time you successfully review a card, the interval to your next reviewmultiplies.For example, let's say our multiplier is 2x. So you review a card on Day 1, then Day 2, then Day4, Day 8, 16, 32, 64... until, with justfifteen reviews, you can remember a card for 215= 32,768 days =ninety years. (In theory. In practice it's less, but still super efficient!)\nAnd that's just foronecard. Thanks to the exponentially-growing gaps, you can add 10 new cards a day (the recommended amount), to long-term retain3650 cardsa year... withless than 20 minutes of reviewa day. (For context, 3000+ cards is enough to master basic vocabulary for a new language! In one year, with just 20 minutes a day!)\nSpaced Repetition is one ofthemost evidence-backed ways to learn (Kang 2016 [pdf]). But outside of language-learning communities & med school, it isn't very well-known...yet.\nSo: how canyouget started with Spaced Repetition?\nFor more info on spaced repetition, check out these videos byAli Abdaal (26 min)andThomas Frank (8 min).\nAndthat'show you can make long-term memory a choice!\nHappy learning! 👍\nWays an AI could \"escape containment\":\nWays an AI could affect the physical world:\nTwo months ago [March 2024], avolunteer, off-the-clockdeveloper found a malicious backdoor in a major piece of code... which wasthree yearsin the making,mere weeks awayfrom going live, and would've attacked the vast majority of internet servers... and this volunteer only caught itby accident, when he noticed that his code was runninghalf a second too slow.\nThis was the XZ Utils Backdoor. Here's a few layperson-friendly(ish) explanations of this sordid affair:Amrita Khalid for The Verge,Dan Goodin for Ars Technica,Tom Krazit for Runtime\nComputer security is a nightmare, complete with sleep paralysis demons.\nPrompt:\n\"Oil painting by Vincent Van Gogh (1889), impasto, textured. A cat-ninja slicing a watermelon in half.\"\nDALL-E 3 generated: (cherry-picked)\n\n\n(wait, is that headband coming out of their eye?!)\nI specifically requested the style of Vincent Van Gogh so y'all can't @ me for \"violating copyright\".

Or will AI help tyrants surveil and manipulate us further? Are the main risks of AI from accidents, abuse by bad actors, or a rogue AIitselfbecoming a bad actor? Is this all just hype? Why can AI imitate any artist's style in a minute, yet gets confused drawing more than 3 objects? Why is it hard to make AI robustly serve humane values, or robustly serveanygoal? What if an AI learns to bemorehumane than us? What if an AI learns humanity'sinhumanity, our prejudices and cruelty? Are we headed for utopia, dystopia, extinction, a fateworsethan extinction, or — the most shocking outcome of all —nothing changes?Also: will an AI take my job?\n...and many more questions.\nAlas, to understand AI with nuance, we must understand lots of technical detail... but that detail is scattered across hundreds of articles, buried six-feet-deep in jargon.\nSo, I present to you:\n\nThis 3-part series is your one-stop-shop to understand the core ideas of AI & AI Safety* — explained in a friendly, accessible, and slightly opinionated way!\n(* Related phrases: AI Risk, AI X-Risk, AI Alignment, AI Ethics, AI Not-Kill-Everyone-ism. There isnoconsensus on what these phrases do & don't mean, so I'm just using \"AI Safety\" as a catch-all.)\nThis series will also have comics starring a Robot Catboy Maid.

For now: Logic is step-by-step cognition, like solving math problems. Intuition is all-at-oncerecognition, like seeing if a picture is of a cat. \"Intuition and Logic\" roughly map onto \"System 1 and 2\" from cognitive science.[1][2](👈 hover over these footnotes! they expand!)\nAs you can tell by the \"scare\" \"quotes\" on\"versus\", these divisions ain't really so divided after all...\nHere's how these conflicts repeat over this 3-part series:\nSkipping over alotof detail, the history of AI is a tale ofLogic vs Intuition:\nBefore 2000: AI was all logic, no intuition.\nThis was why, in 1997, AI could beat the world champion at chess... yet no AIs could reliably recognize cats in pictures.[3]\n(Safety concern: Without intuition, AI can't understand common sense or humane values. Thus, AI might achieve goals in logically-correct but undesirable ways.)\nAfter 2000: AI could do \"intuition\", but had very poor logic.\nThis is why generative AIs (as of current writing, May 2024) can dream up whole landscapes in any artist's style...:yet gets confused drawing more than 3 objects.(👈 click this text! it also expands!)\n(Safety concern: Without logic, we can't verify what's happening in an AI's \"intuition\". That intuition could be biased, subtly-but-dangerously wrong, or fail bizarrely in new scenarios.)\nCurrent Day: Westilldon't know how to unify logic & intuition in AI.\nBut if/when we do,thatwould give us the biggest risks & rewards of AI: something that can logically out-plan us,andlearn general intuition. That'd be an \"AI Einstein\"... or an \"AI Oppenheimer\".\nSummed in a picture:\n\nSo that's \"Logic vs Intuition\". As for the other core conflict, \"Problems in the AI vs The Humans\", that's one of the big controversies in the field of AI Safety: are our main risks from advanced AIitself, or fromhumansmisusing advanced AI?\n(Why not both?)\nTheproblem of AI Safety is this:[4]\nThe Value Alignment Problem:“How can we make AI robustly serve humane values?”\nNOTE: I wrotehumane, with an \"e\", not just \"human\". Ahumanmay or may not behumane. I'm going to harp on this becausebothadvocates & critics of AI Safety keep mixing up the two.[5][6]\nWe can break this problem down by \"Problems in Humans vs AI\":\nHumane Values:“Whatarehumane values, anyway?”(a problem for philosophy & ethics)\nTheTechnicalAlignment Problem:“How can we make AI robustly serveany intended goalat all?”(a problem for computer scientists - surprisingly, still unsolved!)\nThetechnicalalignment problem, in turn, can be broken down by \"Logic vs Intuition\":\nProblems with AI Logic:[7](\"game theory\" problems)\nProblems with AI Intuition:[8](\"deep learning\" problems)\n(Again, what \"logic\" and \"intuition\" are will be more precisely explained later!)\nSummed in a picture:\n\nAs intuition for how hard these problems are, note that we haven't even solved themfor us humans— People follow the letter of the law, not the spirit. People's intuition can be biased, and fail in new circumstances. And none of us are 100% the humane humans we wished we were.\nSo, if I may be a bit sappy, maybe understanding AI will help us understand ourselves. And just maybe, we can solve thehumanalignment problem: How do we gethumansto robustly serve humane values?\nFinally, we can understand some (possible) ways to solve the problems in logic, intuition, AIs,andhumans! These include:\n— and more! Experts disagree on which proposals will work, if any... but it's a good start.\n(Unfortunately, I can't give a layperson-friendly summary in this Intro, because these solutions won't make senseuntilyou understand the problems, which is what Part 1 & 2 are for. That said, if you want spoilers,:click here to see what Part 3 will cover!)\nHey, d'ya ever get this feeling?\nTo avoid that forthisguide, I've included someOPTIONALinteractive flashcards! They use \"Spaced Repetition\", an easy-ish, evidence-backed way to \"make long-term memory a choice\". (:click here to learn more about Spaced Repetition!)\nHere:try the below flashcards, to retain what you just learnt!\n(There's an optional sign-up at the end,ifyou want to save these cards for long-term study. Note:I do not own or control this app, it's third-party. If you'd rather use the open source flashcard appAnki,here'sa downloadable Anki deck!)\n(Also, you don't need to memorize the answersexactly, just the gist. You be the judge if you got it \"close enough\".)\n“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble.\nIt’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.”\n~ often attributed to Mark Twain, but it just ain't so[9]\nFor better and worse, you've already heard too much about AI. So before we connectnewpuzzle pieces in your mind, we gotta take out theoldpieces that just ain't so.\nThus, if you'll indulge me in a \"Top 5\" listicle...\n\nAI Safety / AI Risk used to be less mainstream, but now in 2024, the US & UK governments now have AI Safety-specific departments![10]This resulted from many ofthetop AI researchers raising alarm bells about it. These folks include:\n(To be clear: therearealso top AI researchersagainstfears of AI Risk, such Yann LeCun,[16]co-winner of the 2018 Turing Prize, and chief AI researcher atFacebookMeta. Another notable name is Melanie Mitchell[17], a researcher in AI & complexity science.)\nI'm aware \"look at these experts\" is an appeal to authority, but this isonlyto counter the idea of, \"eh, only sci-fi weebs fear AI Risk\". But in the end, appeal to authority/weebs isn't enough; you have toactually understand the dang thing. (Which youaredoing, by reading this! So thank you.)\nBut speaking of sci-fi weebs...\nSci-fi authors write sentient AIs because they're writingstories, not technical papers. The philosophical debate on artificial consciousness is fascinating,and irrelevant to AI Safety.Analogy: a nuclear bomb isn't conscious, but it can still be unsafe, no?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the real problems in AI Safety are \"boring\": an AI learns the wrong things from its biased training data, it breaks in slightly-new scenarios, it logically accomplishes goals in undesired ways, etc.\nBut, \"boring\" doesn't meannot important. The technical details of how to design a safe elevator/airplane/bridge are boring to most laypeople...and alsoa matter of life-and-death.\n(Catastrophic AI Risk doesn't even require \"super-human general intelligence\"! For example, an AI that's \"only\" good at designing viruses could help a bio-terrorist organization (like Aum Shinrikyo[18]) kill millions of people.)\nBut speaking of killing people...\n\nWhile most AI researchersdobelieve advanced AI poses a 5+% risk of \"literally everybody dies\"[19], it'sveryhard to convince folks (especially policymakers) of stuff that's never happened before.\nSo instead, I'd like to highlight the ways that advanced AI – (especially when it's available to anyone with a high-end computer) – could lead to catastrophes, \"merely\" by scaling upalready-existingbad stuff.\nFor example:\nThe above examples are all \"humansmisuseAI to cause havoc\", but remember advanced AI could do the aboveby itself, due to \"boring\" reasons: it's accomplishing a goal in a logical-but-undesirable way, its goals glitch out but its skills remain intact, etc.\n(Bonus,:Some concrete, plausible ways a rogue AI could \"escape containment\", or affect the physical world.)\nPoint is: even if one doesn't think AI is aliteral 100% human extinctionrisk... I'd say \"homebrew bio-terrorism\" & \"1984 with robots\" are still worth taking seriously.\nOn the flipside...\n\nAI Risk folks aren't Luddites. In fact, they warn about AI's downsidesprecisely becausethey care about AI's upsides.[30]As humorist Gil Stern once said:[31]\n“Both the optimist and the pessimist contribute to society: the optimist invents the airplane, and the pessimist invents the parachute.”\nSo: even as this series goes into detail on how AIis alreadygoing wrong, it's worth remembering the few ways AIis alreadygoing right:\nToo often, we take technology — even life-saving technology — for granted. So, let me zoom out for context. Here's the last 2000+ years of child mortality, the percentage of kids who die before puberty:\n(fromDattani, Spooner, Ritchie and Roser (2023))\nForthousandsof years, in nations both rich and poor, a fullhalfof kids just died. This was a constant. Then, starting in the 1800s — thanks to science/tech like germ theory, sanitation, medicine, clean water, vaccines, etc — child mortality fell off like a cliff. We still have far more to go — I refuse to accept[33]a worldwide 4.3% (1 in 23) child death rate — but let's just appreciate how humanityso swiftly cut downaneons-oldscourge.\nHow did we achieve this? Policy's a big part of the story, but policy is \"the art of the possible\"[34], and the above wouldn't have been possible withoutgoodscience & tech. If safe, humane AI can help us progress further by even just a few percent — towards slaying the remaining dragons of cancer, Alzheimer's, HIV/AIDS, etc — that'd be tens of millions more of our loved ones, who get to beat the Reaper for another day.\nF#@☆ going to Mars,that'swhy advanced AI matters.\n. . .\nWait,really?Toys like ChatGPT and DALL-E arelife-and-deathstakes? That leads us to the final misconception I'd like to address:\nOh come on,one might reasonably retort,AI can't consistently draw more than 3 objects. How's it going to take over the world? Heck, how's it even going to take my job?\nI present to you, arelevant xkcd:\n\nThis is how I feel about \"don't worry about AI, it can't even do [X]\".\nIs our postmodern memory-spanthatbad?Onedecade ago, justone, the world's state-of-the-art AIs couldn't reliablyrecognize pictures of cats.Now, notonlycan AI do that at human-performance level, AIs can pump out:a picture of a cat-ninja slicing a watermelon in the style of Vincent Van Goghinunder a minute.\nIscurrentAI a huge threat to our jobs, or safety? No. (Well, besides the aforementioned deepfake scams.)\nBut: if AI keeps improving at a similar rate as it has for the last decade... it seems plausible to me we could get \"Einstein/Oppenheimer-level\" AI in 30 years.[35]That's well within many folks' lifetimes!\nAs \"they\" say:[36]\nThe best time to plant a tree was 30 years ago. The second best time is today.\nLet's plant that tree today!\n(To review the flashcards, click theTable of Contents icon in the right sidebar, then click the \"🤔 Review\" links.

Now that we've taken the 10,000-foot view, let's get hiking on our whirlwind tour of AI Safety... for us warm, normal, fleshy humans!\nClick to continue ⤵\nPART ONE →\nHi! When I have a tangent that doesn't fit the main flow, I'll shove it into an \"expandable\" section like this one! (They'll be links withdottedunderlines, not solid underlines.)\nAnyway, here's a prompt to draw four objects:\n“A yellow pyramid between a red sphere and green cylinder, all on top of a big blue cube.”\nHere are the top generative AI's first four attempts (notcherry-picked):\nMidjourney:\n\nDALL-E 2:\n\nDALL-E 3:\n\n(The bottom-right one's pretty close! But judging by its other attempts, it's clearly luck.)\nWhy does this demonstrate a lack of \"logic\" in AI? A core part of \"symbolic logic\" is the ability to do \"compositionality\", a fancy way of saying it can reliably combine old things into new things, like \"green\" + \"cylinder\" = \"green cylinder\". As shown above, generative AIs (as of May 2024) areveryunreliable at combining stuff, when there's more than 3 objects.\n~ ~ ~\nAnyway, that's the end of this Nutshell!

But I'm putting this here now, for:\na) The layperson audience, to reassure y'all that, yes, therearemany promising proposed solutions.\nb) The expert audience, to reassure y'all that, yes, I probably have your niche lil' thing in here.\nAnyway, the TOP 10 TYPES-OF-SOLUTIONS to AI Safety: (with the fancy jargon in parentheses)\n“Use it, or lose it.”\nThat's the core principle behind both muscles and brains. (It rhymes, so it must be true!) As decades of educational research robustly show (Dunlosky et al., 2013 [pdf]), if you want to retain something long-term, it's not enough to re-read or highlight stuff: you have to actuallytest yourself.\nThat's why flashcards work so well! But, two problems: 1) It's overwhelming when you havehundredsof cards you want to remember. And 2) It's inefficient to review cards youalreadyknow well.\nSpaced Repetitionsolves both these problems! To see how, let's see what happens if you learn a fact, thendon'treview it. Your memory of it decays over time, until you cross a threshold where you've likely forgotten it:\n\nBut, if you review a factjust beforeyou forget it, you can get your memory-strength back up...and more importantly, your memory of that fact will decayslower!\n\nSo, with Spaced Repetition, we review right before you're predicted to forget a card, over and over. As you can see, the reviews get more and more spread out:\n\nThis is what makes Spaced Repetition so efficient!Every time you successfully review a card, the interval to your next reviewmultiplies.For example, let's say our multiplier is 2x. So you review a card on Day 1, then Day 2, then Day4, Day 8, 16, 32, 64... until, with justfifteen reviews, you can remember a card for 215= 32,768 days =ninety years. (In theory. In practice it's less, but still super efficient!)\nAnd that's just foronecard. Thanks to the exponentially-growing gaps, you can add 10 new cards a day (the recommended amount), to long-term retain3650 cardsa year... withless than 20 minutes of reviewa day. (For context, 3000+ cards is enough to master basic vocabulary for a new language! In one year, with just 20 minutes a day!)\nSpaced Repetition is one ofthemost evidence-backed ways to learn (Kang 2016 [pdf]). But outside of language-learning communities & med school, it isn't very well-known...yet.\nSo: how canyouget started with Spaced Repetition?\nFor more info on spaced repetition, check out these videos byAli Abdaal (26 min)andThomas Frank (8 min).\nAndthat'show you can make long-term memory a choice!\nHappy learning! 👍\nWays an AI could \"escape containment\":\nWays an AI could affect the physical world:\nTwo months ago [March 2024], avolunteer, off-the-clockdeveloper found a malicious backdoor in a major piece of code... which wasthree yearsin the making,mere weeks awayfrom going live, and would've attacked the vast majority of internet servers... and this volunteer only caught itby accident, when he noticed that his code was runninghalf a second too slow.\nThis was the XZ Utils Backdoor.

Hack Clubs around the world use these tools for their projects, but sometimes schools or districts may block them. As a Hack Club leader, you can contact your school or district’s IT department to request that they unblock these websites, so your Hack Club can do what they do best: build awesome projects together.\nSome Hack Club leaders need to convince administrators who don't understand how a Hack Club is different from any other type of CS club that might already exist at the school.\nBelow, we’ve provided examples of letters sent to IT departments in hopes of getting core tools unblocked, and of a letter sent to administrators providing context and differentiating Hack Club from other types of technical clubs.

This introduced predetermined permission sets to control users' access in an organization.\nToday,we're introducing spending controls. This allows managers of HCB organizations to impose a finer level of control on how much money a member can spend.\nTo get to a team member's spending controls page, visit the Team page and click on the$icon next to their name.\nA team member's spending controls page gives you consolidated details of how they're using their cards.\nWhen controls are disabled, a member can spend any amount of money with their cards. (Since they're not managers, so still can't transfer via ACH, check, HCB transfer, etc.)\nWith spending controls enabled, new transactions on Fiona's card will be approved/declined based on Fiona's balance. Since we haven't given her an allowance yet, her balance is zero! (as seen above)\nHint: click theNewbutton on the top right.\nNow that I've given Fiona an allowance, she can spend it with her card! This $2,500 didn't leave the organization's balance when I created an allowance. Instead, both balances will decrease when she makes a purchase.\nYou should probably also know that these allowances are not time-dependent. They don't expire, and they do not recur (it's not a weekly/monthly limit).\nAs a convenience, you can also choose to enable spending controls and set an initial amount when you invite someone to your organization.\nNeed to get somewhere quickly in HCB?

Five years ago, Hack Club HQ used Ledger to keep track of and open source all it's finances:https://github.com/hackclub/ledger. It became too much to maintain. When HQ itself began using HCB, we built Transparency Mode so that we could continue open sourcing our finances. That said, Ledger still is awesome. So now, if you'd like to use the Ledger CLI and are on HCB, you can export your transactions to the.ledgerfile format and have fun exploring your money in the terminal!\nAdditionally, you can also export the transactions of organisations with Transparency Mode enabled, check out HQ's finances:https://hcb.hackclub.com/exports/hq.ledger.\nHey folks! We've got two brand new bits of info to share with you all. First, Hack Club Bank isgrowing— we just hit 💸 $10,000,000 💸 in total transactions for fiscally sponsored organizations! Go you! (and this doesn't even include Hack Club's money!)\nSecond bit of news: the government has some rules about who can— and cannot— call themselves a bank. Now that we've grown a LOT, it's time to change the way we refer to ourselves. As of today,we're shortening our name to HCB.\nTo celebrate, here are 10 acronyms for HCB:\nWe can now be found athcb.hackclub.com,hackclub.com/hcb,hcb@hackclub.com, and so on.

You can opt-in to the feature preview from yourfeature previewspage.\nIn the future we can add the ability to reply directly to the text with a photo of your receipt.\nYou can name your card to help keep everything organized (eg.

For a hackathon organizer who needs tobuy50+burritoswhile herding ~~cats~~ attendees & dodging taxis in NYC, slow money transfers is too much.\nAs of todaywe've improved our account transfers beta to instantly add to your balance.\nDonations usually take 3-5 days from a donor swiping their card to finally arriving in your account. Hackathon organizers often zero out their balance while waiting for a donation payment to arrive.\nYou can nowrequest afrontfor paid funds that are still in transit– if your event is happening within 7 days we'll lend you the funds viaan  instant transfer from us, to you. Once the event is over we'll transfer the funds back out of your account.\nEligible invoices and donations have a button to request a front:\n\nKeep in mind we can only front funds that we can confirm paid (ie. they swiped their card successfully, but the funds haven't arrived yet), and we may take up to 24 hours to get your request. Although we're focusing on hackathons running within 7 days, we know everyone has a different story. If you have a special circumstance, please reach out– we are happy to talk through it with you.\np.s. Users who enabled theaccount transfer betawill also find their transfers reflect in their budgets immediately, instead of the 3-4 days that it used to take.\nLittle update to the donation form: donors can now contribute to your project using Apple Pay! This feature is now available to all organizations running on Hack Club Bank.\n\nToday we're shipping 3 major improvements to the receipt uploading experience on Hack Club Bank!\nYour receipts pageis now smarter– just click \"Add a receipt\" or drag & drop a file to instantly attach your receipt. We've also fixed a bug that caused declined & refunded transactions to show up, even though they don't need receipts.The transaction details page has drag & drop, too– just drop a file anywhere to upload a receipt to that transaction.\nIn a busy checkout line? The “upload a receipt” link we email you has been totally redesigned for mobile, with the ability to take photos of your receipt directly from the page. If you’re uploading from a tablet or laptop, drag-and-drop is also supported.\nFinally, you don’t even have to open Bank– now you can reply to the “upload a receipt” emails with a photo or PDF of your receipt. This is especially useful if you have limited bandwidth and can't load the site.\nWhat's next– receipt upload via direct brain connection? We'd love to hear your ideas, both for receipts and other features– be sure to leave us your feedback in Slack or via the Bank interface!\n\n– Caleb and Max\nA feature preview is live for users to try out:transfers between HCB accounts.\nPeople who are on multiple teams (ie. running a hackathon and running a club with separate accounts) can manage their money across accounts on Hack Club Bank.\n\nPreviously users would have to invoice themselves to move funds. Besides the 7% fee on those funds, it would take between 5-7 days for funds to show up.Transfers cut the time in half and changes \"fee\" to \"free\".\nYou can enable the betain your account settings. Please send me your feedback!\nA new feature preview is available for users to opt-into. Once enabled, you can reply to the automated \"upload your receipt\" emails with your receipt directly– no need to click any links.\n\nYou can enable the previewin your account settings.

Don’t hesitate to reach out via email to bank@hackclub.com or in the#bankchannel on Slack if you have any questions or feedback.\nWe've just rolled out a set of changes around card charges to give a better understanding of where a transaction came from.\n\nEach of these charges are onHack Club HQ.\nHey everyone! (🎺🎺 noises) I’m announcing my first ever feature contribution to Hack Club Bank. 🎉 On your homepage, after logging in, you can now use the section called\"Feedback\"to ... well I think you can guess ... submit any ideas you have for cool new features on Bank! As always, you can still continue to reach out to us on theHack Club Slackor byemail.\n\nFew things are as essential to the banking experience as photo IDs. You always gotta wait for the teller to get a real good look at you, and your ID, before making a transaction. (after all, you wouldn't want your near-identical evil twin stealing your hard-earned money)\nThe Hack Club Bank experience should feel as good or better than a physical IRL bank. Now,you can sign in using just your face (or fingerprint), on supported devices & browsers.\n\nCurrently, this includes modern versions ofGoogle Chrome,Safari, andEdge(as well assomeversionsof Firefox), but you can check for support on your current deviceusing this nifty website.\nHave a Yubikey? Guess what: Bank supports hardware security keys too!\nTo get set up, head on down to the brand newSecurity Keyssection of your Bank settings. You'll be enjoying faster sign-ins in no time!\nI hate passwords. I can neverremember them when I need them, each new account I create means another'unique' password, andpeople are great at leaking them. Wereallydon't want to burden everyone with all that just to access their financial platform, so now it's even easier to login to Hack Club Bank without a password.\nI'm happy to announce thatyou can now get login codes for Hack Club Bank via SMS.The feature can be enabled fromyour settings page.\n\nUsers on iPhone and some Android phones can autofill their SMS login code.\nYou can now get your passwordless login code that much faster– reducing login on some devices down to under 10 seconds.\nThis post is to explain the background details of our switch to Stripe Issuing. Accounts that need action to make the switch will receive an email.\nEmburse cards have been a feature since one of the earliest versions of Hack Club Bank, allowing any team member to spend money with a debit card without dealing with reimbursements. While that’s been amazing, there have been a few trade-offs with using Emburse:\nThese trade-offs made sense when we first started, but lots of details have changed in the last 2 years. Hack Club Bank has grown by…I started doing the math on this, but the comparison is stupid–our first year on Emburse has less than $1k spent per month, last week Bank users spent $20k through their cards. Emburse has been acquired (by a company that renamed to Emburse) & have shifted their product features.\nRecently Emburse announced they’d be removing the card budgeting feature Bank currently relies on. If we stayed on Emburse the new flow would require organizers to request funds for a purchase, staff (Michael / Chaleb) to approve the purchase amount, then the card could make the transaction. Emburse was super gracious about the change, delaying the budget feature removal long enough for us to switch to another platform.\nThe card alternative we’ve eyed for awhile is Stripe Issuing, but it was in private beta we couldn’t access when we built Hack Club Bank. At the time of writing, we’ve got a private version of Stripe Issuing cards running on Hack Club Bank (only available to admins) to make sure our new system works. I’m happy to say it improves many of the previous issues with cards:\nThis is obviously a big change, and if you have any questions/comments please let us know either by reaching out to bank@hackclub.com or posting in the#bankchannel on Slack.\n4 major improvements to Bank live today:\nAll of this is live for everyone now. More to come! 👀\nThanks to our generous friends over at repl.it, in light of COVID-19,Hack Club Bank users get a free Hacker plan for the next year.

It’s limited to the first 500 people who claim it, so don’t wait.\nHope you’re safe & well. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reply & ask away!\nLast week, we launched a new feature in Hack Club Bank:Transparency Mode.\nWith Transparency Mode, you can open source your finances instantly from your account settings page. Why would you want to do that? Nonprofit donors deserve to know what their contributions are funding—as a hackathon/nonprofit, you can talk about what you’re spending money on, but transparency in every transaction builds trust for supporters. It’s already live in action!\nThat’s not all. When Hack Club first started, Zach’s hope was to build a different kind of organization: one not only open source with code, but open source with its finances too. Every month, Zach would painstaking put every transactionon GitHub. Unfortunately, as we grew, the tooling took too long & we had to outsource our books to an accounting firm that didn’t know what GitHub was.\nWe’ll be sharing this publicly next week, but Bank users are getting a sneak peek today:Hack Club HQ has been running entirely on Bank for months now, and our finances are public. Dig in, right here:bank.hackclub.com/hq.\nLet’s set a new standard in financial transparency for nonprofits.

Where'd that $14.80 go? Welcome to the world of payment processing. (HC Bank usesStripe)\nPayment processing fees are annoying. Calculating them ahead of time is frustrating and the result is alwayslessmoney for your event, club, or project.\nStarting today, Hack Club Bank will make all your payment processing fees disappear.\nThis means that regardless of whether a sponsor is paying via credit card, ACH, or wire, when you send an invoice for $500, you'll receive $500.\nAnd we're taking it even further.\nI'm proud to share we're also reimbursing all previous payment processing fees, from all time, for everyone.\nDepending on the size of past invoices, you'll receive somewhere between $4.48 and $390.50 (actual numbers) granted to your HC Bank account this week.\nIf you want to read more, check out ourblog post with the full story.\nP.S.

They vanished when the pandemic hit, and went missing as the world emerged from the pandemic. Our 2022 summer project was to kick off a hackathon renaissance, together with Hack Clubbers.\nTo do this, we hostedthe first major high-school hackathonsince 2020,open sourcedthe entire event &launched a series of supportsfor high school hackathon organisers based on our experience.\nThe goal of this repository is to be a reference for high schoolers looking to organise their own hackathon. No hackathon is the same but we hope that within this repository you can find inspiration for you own special event.\nLooking for a how-to? ReadAn Expandable Guide to Hackathon Organizing.\n\nAhackathonis not an extracurricular or a club. It's not a class or a lecture. Hackathons are a place to build things for fun and meet others doing the same. Going into organising Assemble,we brainstormed what a magical hackathon looked like, from those brainstorms we developed the following framework for a great hackathon:\nRead more about Hack Club's Philosophy ➚\n\nAssemble ran from 6PM on Friday to 12PM on Sunday. That's 42 hours to make our own. Creating a great hackathon, means designing a spectacular attendee experience as well as a great organiser experience. There are a fair few components to this including, but not limited to, planned (as well as unplanned)activities,judging,swag,foodandceremonies. The specifics of each at Assemble are detailed in their respective files in/the-event.\n\nRead more in/the-event➚\n\nThere's only so much organisers can do to make a wonderful hackathon, it is the attendees who bring a hackathon alive. As an organiser, your role in this process is to make sureeveryone who needs to hear about your hackathon does, to convert these potential participants into attendees, tomake sure they're all setfor the event and then to inspire them to embrace the spirit of the hackathon. At the same time, you may choose to invite non-high schoolers to mentor and talk with the attendees. At Assemble, we wanted to make sure such relationships were casual and human, an approach you can read more abouthere.\nRead more in/the-attendees➚\n\nAssemble had a budget of $75,000, that's a large budget for a high school hackathon. HS hackathon budgets can range anywhere from $500 to $75,000. Whatever your budget is, you'll find a similar set of expenses will arise between all hackathons. Every expense made for Assemble has been open sourcedherethrough HCB'stransparency mode. As an organiser, you'll need toraise money,create an itemized budget(which accounts for the unexpected) and thenspend the moneyraised as planned.\nExplore our budget sheet ➚orread more in/the-budget➚\n\nSince the pandemic began,finding a venuehas became by far the most challenging aspect of organising a hackathon. Assemble was hosted across two floors in Figma's San Francisco office, situated in thePhelan Buildingon Market Street. Getting there took almost 40% of the time spent organising the event, however, when the event rolled around it was well and truly worth it. Figma's space was creatively inspiring and provided the perfect home for Assemble. As an organiser, you'll need to make pitches to potential venues, convince a venue to buy into your event, set up the venue for success and finish by making the venue providerfeel appreciated.\nRead more in/the-venue➚\nBelow you can find a series of resources curated and created by the Assemble team that we hope will help you when organising your own events.\nThe majority of work on Assemble was done in a month, from July 5th to August 5th. Every week of that month,@sampoderwrote a journal update on the Assemble organising process. Together they tell the story of how Assemble went from an idea to an event for 175 hackers.\n👋 Issue #1: Getting Started in Vermont, July 8th\n😫 Issue #2: Everything Gets Really Difficult Really Fast, July 15th\n👣 Issue #3: Gaining My Footing, July 24th\n🎉 Issue #4: Starting To See Light At The End of The Tunnel, July 30th\n👨‍🚒 Issue #5: Seeing The Event Across The Line, August 5th\n😥 Issue #6: Looking Back, August 13th\nAcross this repository, you'll find the fabulous photographs of Assemble by@kunalbotla, a Hack Clubber from Boston. The full album can be found here (all Hack Clubbers can use these photos in their projects!):hack.af/assemble-photos.

        "content": "Curious exactly what happens when you run a program on your computer? Read this article to learn how multiprocessing works, what system calls really are, how computers manage memory with hardware interrupts, and how Linux loads executables.\nByLexi Mattick&Hack Club·\n\t\t\t\tJuly, 2023\nI’ve donea lot of things with computers, but I’ve always had a gap in my knowledge: what exactly happens when you run a program on your computer? I thought about this gap — I had most of the requisite low-level knowledge, but I was struggling to piece everything together. Are programs really executing directly on the CPU, or is something else going on? I’ve used syscalls, but how do theywork? What are they, really? How do multiple programs run at the same time?\nI cracked and started figuring as much out as possible. There aren’t many comprehensive systems resources if you aren’t going to college, so I had to sift through tons of different sources of varying quality and sometimes conflicting information. A couple weeks of research and almost 40 pages of notes later, I think I have a much better idea of how computers work from startup to program execution. I would’ve killed for one solid article explaining what I learned, so I’m writing the article that I wished I had.\nAnd you know what they say… you only truly understand something if you can explain it to someone else.\nIn a hurry? Feel like you know this stuff already?\nRead chapter 3and I guarantee you will learn something new. Unless you’re like, Linus Torvalds himself.\n[This Space Intentionally Left Blank]\nThe bottom of every page is padded so readers can maintain a consistent eyeline.\nOpen source with ❤︎ on GitHub\nOther editions:One-Pager·PDF",

If you’re a member of multiple HCB organizations, it can be hard telling your cards apart.\nI’ve started writing the organization name on the back of mine:\n\nWe’ve got a more elegant solution for you all, however. You can now customise the logo printed in the top right and we’ve started printing the organization name on the card:\n\n(Apexis a high-altitude balloon-forcused hackathon running on HCB!)\nPlus, we’ve got white cards now. Fancy.\n\nIt's that time of year again! We know you've been hard at work on your nonprofit projects, and we want to celebrate the achievements you've made in 2024. That's why we're excited to announce HCB Wrapped 2024, your year in review!\n\nCheck it out here:hcb.hackclub.com/wrapped\nWe hope you enjoy it. Happy holidays! 🎉\nNote:You need to have access to the Google Workspace perk on HCB to use this feature\nHave you ever needed to have multiple emails for your organization (like help@, sponsor@, [your name]@)?\nPreviously, you would have had to create a new account for each address, but you no longer need to.\nOn HCB, you can now create up to 30 aliases per Google Workspace account; all emails to an alias will be sent to its parent account's inbox. No more having to flip through 10 different inboxes!\n\nToday we're launching a new way to stay up-to-date on HCB:our new blog.\nFor as long as I can remember, HCB has been usingHeadwayto announce product updates and changes to users, but over time our needs have shifted. Along with changelog updates, we want to share more content online, like engineering deep-dives, our monthly newsletters, and more.\nWith this change, all of our posts are now open source and available onGitHubas well.\nWe're excited to share more with you in the future. Stay tuned!\nFor a long time, HCB cards appeared as a mysterious, dark, unbranded card in your Apple Wallet.\n\nToday, we're excited to announce that it's getting a new look! Some people might say it's fresh & crisp, just like a juicy apple 🍎. Enjoy!\n\nThanks to Ian and Sam for the design work!\nExciting news for organizations doing work outside the US! HCB now supports sending money to overseas bank accounts via an international wire:\n\nTo send an international wire, you'll need your recipient's bank's SWIFT code and account number as well as some country-specific information. Once you've got that, it's just like sending an ACH transfer to a US bank account on HCB.\nUnfortunately, wires are expensive to send. Our partner bank charges us $25 per wire; therefore, to keep HCB sustainable without passing this fee onto you, each wire sent must be at least $500. We've waived this requirement for organizations that have raised over $50k.\nWhen we need help from you, we want to make sure we're reaching out to the right people.\nBy default, we'll email everyone who is a part of your team on HCB. However, if you have a shared team email or would prefer for us to reach out to a specific email, you can now let us know:\n\nAre you trying to manually link your organization'saccount & routing numberswith a 3rd party service? Sometimes these services will ask for a bank account letter that proves you have access to your account number.\nLuckily for you, sitting right on your documents page is averification letteryou can share. ✨✅\nThis handy one-pager allows organizations on HCB to prove they have access to their account & routing numbers.\n\nLooking for a little bit of extra security? You can now turn on two-factor authentication for your account:\n\nThat'll prompt you for two authentication factors each time you log in, whether it's a hardware security key, a login code sent to your email/phone, or a time-based one time password.\nYou know what they say about 2FA, you may find it mildly annoying but baddies find it infuriating.Ok, no one says that but you get the point.\nAre you a part of multiple organizations on HCB? Simply click on your organization's title to navigate between them! 🔥\n",

        "content": "Hack Club is a 21st century cultural institution, run by teenagers for teenagers, that prizes technical skills, an entrepreneurial mindset, and a rigorous dedication to building real things in the real world that solve real problems.\nLed by young engineers, with early backing from the 21st century’s most iconic creators, Hack Club is already in 2 percent of US schools, and represents the largest network of technical teens in the world.\nEach day, new projects are shipped, new lines of code are written, and new friendships are forged through collaborative, problem-solving technical projects happening at Hack Club.\nWith your support, Hack Club can grow from 1,000s to 10,000s of teen hackers, bringing free computer science education, a hacker mindset, and an equal shot at success to every teenager, regardless of where they’re from, how they identify, or what their parents do.\nFewer than half US highschools offer CS classes\nWith an annual budget less than a single, small public highschool, Hack Club brings CS education to thousands of teenagers. Our goal: become the Girl and Boy Scouts of the 21st century.\nHack Clubbers at SpaceX, July 2021:See the video\nIn the next ten years, Hack Club will discover, foster and inspire thousands more teenagers to become highly technical. We help shape the values of these future leaders, modeling and incentivizing them to be curious, humble, kind, optimistic problem solvers.\nHack Club is founded and run by teenagers.\nOur board members are all 21st century founders, innovators, and builders.\nMost of our team is technical and are building what they wish they had.\nHack Clubbers code in languages like Rust, Typescript, Haskell, Go and ship projects people use.\nAll teens, regardless of background, join Hack Club.\nHack Club is the only nonprofit in the country with 100% financial transparency\nEleeza, a 16-year-old Hack Clubber from London, UK, created \"Double-Edged Blade: All Under Control”, a 2D visual novel video game! She created, illustrated and wrote the entire thing, and along the way she posted updates and asked Hack Clubbers for storyline suggestions all on her personal channel at Hack Club.\n\"Hack Club is awesome”\n“There’s so much positivity”\n\"[Hack Club] has given me the confidence to imagine, build, and explore.”\nLeading a Hack Club at her school\nHosting an AMA with Elon Musk\n\"Really awesome\"\nNo offense! Aiden, 16, used Tensorflow to trigger a photo every time he gives his device the middle finger. It’s a parody of selfie culture, and a pretty popular ship at Hack Club!\n\"After raising $5M for The Fuller Project and taking it from a start-up to an established organization, I knew that this was my chance to help build something poised to make real change in our 21st century world - and, importantly, with girls at the forefront.\"\n\"In addition to allowing the public to hold these organizations accountable, transparent finances help founders and board members make the right decisions in the first place since they know they’re operating under public scrutiny.\"\n\"For eight days, the future would roll and click across the USA.\"\n\"Teenagers across the country are forming hacking clubs, attending hackathons and trying to spread the word that hacking doesn’t always mean breaking into government servers or stealing bank data.\"\n\"Do you know Zach Latta?” ... “You know he rebuilt Yo’s backend. He’s baller.”\n\"Zach Latta found many people who were willing to listen, leaving high school to move to San Francisco on his own to start a nonprofit called Hack Club.\"\nHack Club invites the 21st century’s leading thinkers, builders and disrupters to join our small, core network of donors with a gift.\nFounded in 2014, Hack Club grew 700 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Hack Club’s team of engineers can’t keep up with demand.\nWith your gift, Hack Club could increase engineering support to serve thousands more teenagers, with a strong focus on serving those who face additional barriers to contributing their talents to the world.\n“Hack Club is the organization I wish I had when I was a teenager. In 2017, I joined as a founding board member, and I’ve seen firsthand the leadership team act with integrity and transparency since Day 1. Founder Zach Latta and COO Christina Asquith are efficient, responsible and disciplined stewards of every dollar, and I've proudly grown my donations over the years.\nWith major support, I am confident Hack Club will change the world. I have met dozens of teenagers involved in Hack Club, and seen how it already is having an enormous impact in their lives.\nHack Club is inspiring a generation of teenagers to become highly-technical builders, innovators and problem-solvers — and it is making the path to success accessible to all young people regardless of background. I believe in Hack Club, and I'm looking forward to staying involved for the long term. I also personally intend to continue and grow my financial support of their mission.\"",

Each kid and parent who attends our club meetings hears your story and we work on enrolling all of them in the mission that we share.Though we haven’t started our meetings yet this year, I look forward to continuing this work for the future!Happy Birthday again and best wishes for the years to come!!-Cayce and Roland.\nHey Zach! Happy 21st birthday. The contributions you have made to this community are absolutely incredible. You inspire me to work hard, and I hope you understand how much of an impact you’ve had. But anyway, you’re 21! Party it up, enjoy dude.\nOh me oh my, I sure do love nuts. And I’m so happy it’s National Nut Day. They’re so nutritious and great, I eat them all the time. I saved my favorite ones for winter though by putting them in the hollow under the old willow tree.

Sign upherebefore June 07!\nHigh schooler?Get stickers!\nOrpheus gets mail\nEasel, the programming language\nVariables\nComments\nStructs\nFunctions\nLoops and if-else statements\nSetup\nIt's a normal Saturday for Orpheus the dinosaur. Or rather, not normal. This is the first Saturday in a while where she can lie in bed alone, look out the window, and daydream about whatever she wants to. No tea parties to go to, no meetings, no nothing. She can just lie in bed and think about pancakes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\nWhat a perfect day. You know what would be even more perfect? Actual pancakes. Blueberry pancakes, chocolate pancakes, banana pancakes. That means she has got to get out of bed and check if she has those ingredients. She rolls over and out of bed and into the kitchen.\nWhen she gets to the kitchen, there's a knock on the door. Now, Orpheus' house is laid out in such a way that the front door leads to the kitchen. Or rather, the kitchen leads to the front door. (The magic of perspective.)\nI know when you read this you will be most suspicious of me, the narrator. Trust me. I am not the mysterious person that you will learn about later. I just happen to be omnipresent.\nPerfect timing!, she thinks.Almost like someone knows what I'm doing at the current moment.\nThe doorbell rings insistently again. Orpheusrunsstomps her way over to the door and opens it, but no one's there! She looks around. Nobody's around. It's kind of a dull and gray day outside, honestly, although the rain is making nice pitter-patter sounds on the porch screens.\nShe looks down. There's a box at her feet. Ooh. Could it be fan mail? She bends down to pick it up.\nYes, Orpheus gets fan mail. If you want to send her some after reading this\nyou can send them to 15 Falls Road, Shelburne VT 05482.\nShe rips apart the box with her claws, and three things fall out: a keyboard sort of thing with a very small screen (a computer??), a grid-like boxy sort of contraption (something like this.Orpheus and I couldn't come up with a better description when we were arguing over the sequence of events), and a nice, fancy piece of paper that Orpheus can't help but put her nose up to. It smells good. Like paper, you know?\nOrpheus reads the letter.\nI hope this letter finds you well. Maybe on a cozy rainy Saturday morning. In the confines of this package (there is only so much you can fit inside a decent package when you are trying to adhere to USPS shipping guidelines while also trying to be budget-friendly), there are two things: a computer unlike anything you normally use, for interfacing with the second thing, an easel.\nThe easel is a blank, sad thing right now. You need to paint it. Now, you can't paint it with any normal paint and brush. What, do you think this is, that one boy with that one purple crayon that he can just make random shite come to life with by scribbling?\nNo,you must talk to it.\nI know you've wanted to be an artist. And now you have a chance to be a special one. An artist who can also perform magic! Figure out how to talk to the easel with the computer I have provided, and you can do both. Hint: you need to write a programming language. The one I have included is called Easel, and is a good starting point.\nThere is much you'll learn along the way. You might even find that there's a surprise or two, too. (See what I did there? Punny. Yes, I am quite a humorous person. It is something I pride myself on. Quite masterful at pranks, too.)\nYou'll probably go back to cooking pancakes or something. There are many reasons to do this, though, and here I'll rank them in alphabetical order:\nFrom the narrator: programming language idea? Star Wars-based programming language? Very based. (I heard that's the hip word nowadays.)\nSigned,\nyour mysterious sender\nP.S. I know that you would like to know who I am because who doesn't? So let's strike a compromise. Once you figure out how to paint this easel, you'll be able to run this:\nAnd figure out who I am.\nOrpheus is slightly taken aback. Erm, crepey. Sorry, creepy. Her stomach rumbles. Sorry. Just a little bit hungry. How does this mysterious sender know everything that is happening, in real time? Guess the only way to find out is to write that programming language.\nHm. Orpheus could go cook pancakes, or she could figure out this easel and who in the hecktie-neckties this mysterious person is. Or she could do both.\nShe's never written a programming language before, but then, I presume you haven't, either. This is an invitation for you to join Orpheus' pancake party.\nGo cook your pancakes! We'll be back in half an hour.\nThese are the recipes we used. I found them in one of Orpheus' many drawers, but I don't think it's her because the handwriting's way too neat.\nOk. Now that we both have a steaming pile of pancakes, let's take a look at Easel:\nIs that...Conway's Game of Life? Yup, and\nwe're going to get it to run on an easel.\nI bet you can already start to see the different features Easel has. Orpheus can, although it's ended up in a lot of dripping syrup over the letter.\nVariables are created with thepreparekeyword andaskeywords, likeprepare [name] as [value]. We can have strings, numbers, booleans, or arrays.\nGrammar mistake! It's not \"Me and Orpheus\", it's \"Orpheus and I\"! Call the\ngrammar police!\nComments are dictated by the tilde symbol. Me and Orpheus have decided that it looks pretty similar to her eyebrows when she's surprised by something, and comments help you when you're surprised by a piece of code, so we've decided that it's a pretty effective way of annotating our comments.\nStructs are basically maps/objects/dicts/whatever you want to call them with a predefined list of keys. Defining a struct looks something likebrush Cell has { x, y, live }. Creating a struct looks something likeprep Cell(x: 1, y: 1, live: false). Get it? You're prepping a brush. Hehe.\nWe call functions sketches so we define them with the sketch keyword. If a function takes in parameters, you'll need to use theneedskeyword before defining those.\nThese are pretty obvious.\nEasel also has support for the usual operators: AND&&, OR||, and NOT!.\nOrpheus wipes her mouth with her hands and pushes her plate aside. Let's start doing this! We're going to make sure we have the basics first. It's like building Lego, really. The first step is to open dat terminal and start a new project:\nOf course, if you're on a Chromebook or some device of that sort, and you've been following along with our built-in editor, you won't be able to follow this step or the following ones. Just skip down to writing the actual code.\nOpen up thepackage.jsonthat's been created, and add this extra line that'll let us use the modernimportsyntax.\nNext, let's start writing some code! Here's some boilerplate code to go insideeasel.js:\nGo ahead. Type it out! It's good for your health. Well, to be specific, it's\ngood for Orpheus' health. She only has three claws (fingers?) on either hand.\nHer hand-o-pedon (yes, I learned today that it's a thing) says it's good for\nher health. I trust doctors. [shrugs] Anyways, I digress. You can't copy it, unless you're reallydesperate, and that's kind of sad.\nLet's also get some error handling in there. It'll be useful later on for checking if errors are being thrown by our programming language or by JavaScript. Create a new file namedstdlib.jsand throw this in there:\nYou can runnode easel.js test.easelnow and it's rather boring. We could probably spruce it up a bit by writing that programming language. Let's get a-moving!\nNext →\nOrpheus writes a lexer\nHack Club is a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that supports a network of 20k+ technical high schoolers.

You’re someone I look up to\r\n      also for your work and influence outside of Hack Club. Thank you so much\r\n      for the patience, advice, and encouragement that you’ve given me.\nDina\nHappy birthday Christina!\nSince you joined in February, Hack Club started to never be the same. The\r\n      relentlessness, kindness, and thoughtful leadership you've brought to Hack\r\n      Club make us better every day.\nI can't think of a better person to be running this org with.

I hope\r\n      this year is the best year yet.\nby Fischler\nHey Christina!\nWhen Zach called me a while ago to talk about bringing you onto the team,\r\n      I was psyched. Your track record as a professional spoke for itself, you\r\n      had amazing potential to bring some much needed direction to the team, and\r\n      you sounded like a perfect fit. You have done— and been—all of that and\r\n      moe.

I am so honored that I've been able to work with you this past Summer and empower over 370 students in technology. Your willingness to help others around you has helped me see the power of community in STEM and I'm grateful to have you as a role model to look up to. Thank you so much for always believing in me and dedicating your time to hearing about an idea I came up with on a whim. I'm so excited to see you take to Hack Club to even greater heights and work with you in the future! I hope you have a great day :)\nShivali Gulati\nHappy birthday Christina!\nI wassoooexcited when I first heard you were joining Hack Club\r\n      because it meant we were finally getting our first teammate who's a real\r\n      adult and professional!\nI vividly remember the first time I met you, in early March, when you came\r\n      to New Haven and chatted with the clubs team about the long-term future of\r\n      Hack Club. That conversation made me incredibly excited for the future of\r\n      Hack Club, both long-term and while I'm working here. I continue to be\r\n      amazed by what you bring to Hack Club.\nPlus, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have visited the magical land of\r\n      Vermont, which I now believe is an undiscovered gem of the world!Stay awesome,Matthew ✨\nWoot woot!! Happy Birthday Christina!!!\nHey!! Christina, you are an inspiration to so many people! Your \r\n      previous work in the Middle East is really fascinating, it's something\r\n      that is quite foreign to many of us so it's really interesting hearing \r\n      stories about it. You've always been super kind to me and it was great \r\n      to do stuff with you over the summer! Keep going with the coding, it's \r\n      really cool! Have a great rest of your birthday!!\n- Sam P\nWow it's your birthday!\nChristina, you have been a truly awesome person to get to know/work with.\r\n      Your tenacity, kind-hartedness, and just Hack Club mom personality (😛)\r\n      just highlights what a great person you are.

        "content": "Fueling the sprit of coding teenagers over almost 8 years, HackerClub is\n      an enormous organization with wide support for the interests of teenagers\n      around the world. Countless students here within Texas have taken the\n      support of club leaders in their schools and we hear of the enormous\n      success of their events. For example, theirOuter nethack-a-thon this\n      summer got youth around from the entire world to work on projects together\n      in Vermont, Vt, USA. It is from HackerClub that many students of UT Austin\n      attribute their coding journey to, something that we love to hear about at\n      our universities.\nSparking the fuse of excitement in students is the state of Texas's\n        education goal, and we find that HackerClub best aligns with these\n        goals. It is in our best interests to carry forward this new generation\n        of studious young leaders in the Lonestar state, which is why we must\n        support this prestigious organization. HackerClub supports students to\n        open their own \"HackerClubs\" in their own highscools, which allows their\n        peers to benefit from added knowledge after school. It is this program\n        that we found interesting within HackerClub, and we would like to widen\n        the scope of this to all high school students in the Texas state.\nadd more description here - george\nFrom the wide reach of their \"Slack\" online chats, we have found it\n      important to increase the reach of this organization. Hence, we will be\n      partnering with HackerClub to provide these clubs to all schools in the\n      state of Texas. These clubs will be led by a qualified teacher with a\n      minimum knowledge requirement of programming. The various tasks that these\n      clubs will do will be great and spread knowledge to all students and bring\n      the state of Texas to the forefront of computing, rivaling big tech hubs\n      like the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and New York. Partnering with\n      the University of Texas & Texas Education Agency means that HackerClub\n      will be able to utilize our vast net of resources to spread the joy of\n      computer programming to the future leaders of America. We hope that this\n      new partnership will bring about a great step forward and positive changes\n      to the state of Texas's student performance.\nThis great partnership will be named the TEACH initiative, and we hope to\n      include more partners in the future as well.",

        "content": "Curious exactly what happens when you run a program on your computer? Read this article to learn how multiprocessing works, what system calls really are, how computers manage memory with hardware interrupts, and how Linux loads executables.\nByLexi Mattick&Hack Club·\n\t\t\t\tJuly, 2023\nI’ve donea lot of things with computers, but I’ve always had a gap in my knowledge: what exactly happens when you run a program on your computer? I thought about this gap — I had most of the requisite low-level knowledge, but I was struggling to piece everything together. Are programs really executing directly on the CPU, or is something else going on? I’ve used syscalls, but how do theywork? What are they, really? How do multiple programs run at the same time?\nI cracked and started figuring as much out as possible. There aren’t many comprehensive systems resources if you aren’t going to college, so I had to sift through tons of different sources of varying quality and sometimes conflicting information. A couple weeks of research and almost 40 pages of notes later, I think I have a much better idea of how computers work from startup to program execution. I would’ve killed for one solid article explaining what I learned, so I’m writing the article that I wished I had.\nAnd you know what they say… you only truly understand something if you can explain it to someone else.\nIn a hurry? Feel like you know this stuff already?\nRead chapter 3and I guarantee you will learn something new.

Some of you may be familiar with\n                    building projects that try to “win.” Wonderland isn’t like\n                    that.\nIn the heart of Boston, we challenge you and your team to\n                    take the rabbit hole’s random assortment of parts—chests—and\n                    turn them into something that’s truly wonderful.\nOnly when we limit ourselves do we become truly free.\nBoston, MA from the evening of Friday, February 23th to the\n                    morning of Sunday, February 25th.\nJoin us.\nThe first thing every project needs is a clear,\n                    well-thought-out plan. Right???\nWhen we start a project, we often start by figuring out the\n                    \"right\" way to start, or the “right” tools to use. We\n                    research Python vs Typescript, ATTiny vs ATMega. More often\n                    than not, we lose the very thing we started with: excitement\n                    about our idea!\nBut what if youdon’thave every tool in\n                    the world? What if youcan’tuse the right\n                    tool for the job? What ifall you haveis\n                    the stuff within arm’s reach? Only when you’re limited do\n                    you find yourself truly free — free tojust start making.\nIntroducingChests— Wonderland's mystery\n                    boxes of knicks and knacks. From aPython horoscope libraryto a rubber duck, your job will be to find a way to make a\n                    project with them.\nWe’re super excited to announce that Wonderland will be\n                    located at the WPS Institute in Newton, MA. Wonderland is\n                    free of charge to attend, so we want to make sure you can\n                    make it out! If you’re not from the Boston area, no problem.\n                    You’ve got options.\nWant more info about how to get to our venue?\nA limited number of travel grants to partially cover flight\n                    costs are available. Our registration form will ask for your\n                    approximate location, and we’ll use that information to get\n                    back to you on what grants are available.\nFind more info about flight grants here.\nBoston is lucky to be a center of public transit. If you\n                    live in the Northeast, you can likely get to Boston via bus\n                    or train. With theHack Club Gas Fund,\n                    we’ll even reimburse some of the costs!\nAmtrakhas a few\n                    routes stopping in Boston’s South Station.

Don't worry, we're not doing any computer\n                        hacking. Wonderland isn’t like your typical hackathon,\n                        though. You’re not required to do any coding at\n                        Wonderland.\nWe welcome hackers from all backgrounds and skill\n                        levels. All you need is the attitude to make something!\n                        Wonderland is a place for beginners and experienced\n                        makers alike!\nNothing! We’ll have meals, snacks, and beverages onsite\n                        at the event, as well as swag and fun mini-events. We\n                        also have a limited number of travel stipends for\n                        students who need help getting to Boston. Check out the\n                        Travel section for more details.\nYour laptop, chargers, toiletries, sleeping bags, a\n                        refillable water bottle, and the spirit of an explorer!\nOn the night of the event we will have a designated\n                        gender-seperated and supervised sleeping area in the\n                        venue with lowlights and minimal sound for you to rest.\n                        Make sure to bring a sleeping bag!\nNo! Unlike most hackathons, you’ll be placed into a team\n                        ahead of time. We’ll assemble groups we anticipate will\n                        work well together, and you’ll get to know each other\n                        throughout the weekend. Don’t worry, you won’t be\n                        evaluated based on your experience. Using our patented\n                        team-maker formula 9000™️, we’ll find teams with vibes\n                        that match!\nReach out to us! We’re happy to talk to them. Wonderland\n                        will be supervised by a background checked staff and\n                        overseen by 24/7 security staff.

We will be showcasing the AI, the voice, and the movement of the robot.\n\nTake a deeper look at the star of the show, GLaDOS.\nGLaDOS is a sarcastic, artificial intelligence computer system that appears in the video games Portal and Portal 2. Portal is a video game series where the player solves puzzles using a portal gun to create portals on surfaces. GLaDOS is the main antagonist of the series.\n                Last year, the Advanced Coding and Robotics ECA group(member list)built a life-sized replica of GLaDOS. The robot was built using a 3D printer and programmed to sustain a conversation with a person. It was featured in the STEM Show last year and was a hit among the audience. Its biggest accomplishment was attending theAI for Good Global Summitat the Ecolint booth.\n\nImage byITU Pictures, taken by S. Jacobson-Walsh, used underCC BY-NC-SA 2.0.

        "content": "We read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously.\nTo see all available qualifiers, see ourdocumentation.\nThe Conductor who routes Coolify notifications to the right Slack channel\nCoolify supports sending notifications to Slack. However, it sends all notifications to a single Slack channel. This\nmeans that all app's deployment notifications end up in one noisy channel rather than each project's respective\nSlack channel.\nThis simple Go app solves this problem by serving as a reverse proxy. It mirrors 🪞 notifications to their respective\nproject channels.\nIn order to route notification to the right Slack channel, The Conductor requires a list ofDestinations. Each\nDestination consists of:\nWhen a new notification webhook is sent to The Conductor, it builds a list of relevant Destinations and mirrors the\nnotification to them. Pretty simple!\nSo, how does The Conductor determine whether a Destination is relevant for a given notification?\nIt uses the Destination's regex(es). If any of the Destination's regexes matches any part of the notification webhook's\npayload (body), then the notification will be sent to the Destination's Slack channel.\nA typical Slack notification looks like this\n\nHowever, it's webhook payload is JSON (built using Slack'sBlock Kit).\nThis means that when writing regular expressions for Destinations, you must consider the JSON payload itself. Here's an\nexample of one of those payloads:\nbut without the nice formatting (no new lines or indentation).\nTo begin, configurations are located in theconfig.ymlfile.\nAs mentioned above, each Destination requires a Slack webhook URL and one (or multiple) regexes.\nHang on to that URL.\nKeep in mind you may need to escape certain special characters.\nFor examples, I'd recommend reading theconfig.ymlfile. However, here are a few things to know:\nProject-related notifications (e.g. Deployment success) include its project name.\nSo, you can use that to match all notification related to your project.\nIt may be helpful to look at existing notification messages to see what to match for. You can find them in\nthe#coolify-notifschannel. Since coolify is open source, you\ncan also find their notification templateshere.\nInsideconfig.yml, add a new array item under thedestinationskey. That item should have the\nfollowing keys:\nHere's an example:\nThis Destination is namedHCB_ENGR_NOTIFS. The regex will match notifications for the\nprojectsgary@mfa,gary@g-verify, andian@bank-shields.\nYou might notice that you're still hanging onto that Slack channel webhook URL. So, where does that go?\nSince Slack webhook URLs should be treated like secrets, they're not stored in this codebase. Instead, the app will look\nfor them in its environment variables. In the example above, since the Destination's name isHCB_ENGR_NOTIFS, the app\nexpects an environment variable calledWEBHOOK_HCB_ENGR_NOTIFS_URLto be set. It MUST be set, otherwise, the app\nrefuses the boot.\nThe environment variableMUSTbe added before merging your changes!\nThe Conductor will always send all notification to the main channel. This is currently set\nas#coolify-notifsand is configured via theWEBHOOK_MAIN_URL.\nvia Docker on Coolify.\nSet the following environment variables:\nThe Conductor who routes Coolify notifications to the right Slack channel",

It revolutionized nonprofit financial transparency and allowed donors and the public to see how an organization utilizes funds. However, we’ve found that showcasing every transaction can sometimes mean extra housekeeping work for teams to keep the ledger tidy.\nThat’s why we’re excited to announce AI-powered memos for transactions!\nNow, with 1-click, you can generate a transaction memo summarizing the receipt for any transaction. It’s pretty simple:\nYou’ll also notice that the receipt sidebar now includes some extracted information that provides a glanceable overview of the receipt’s contents.\nAs usual, we want to hear what you think!\nThere's nothing worse than checking for your card and realizing it's fallen out of your pocket. Now, when that happens, you can burn the card to cancel it and prevent any future transactions.\nIn the dark days of HCB, inviting people to your organization was always a binary risk assessment - \"do I give this person unfettered access to everything, or nothing at all?\"\nOnce we realized this was Suboptimal And A Bit Dangerous™️, we started to think about operational security from users' perspectives more carefully.\nUser roleswas step one. This introduced predetermined permission sets to control users' access in an organization.\nToday,we're introducing spending controls. This allows managers of HCB organizations to impose a finer level of control on how much money a member can spend.\nTo get to a team member's spending controls page, visit the Team page and click on the$icon next to their name.\nA team member's spending controls page gives you consolidated details of how they're using their cards.\nWhen controls are disabled, a member can spend any amount of money with their cards. (Since they're not managers, so still can't transfer via ACH, check, HCB transfer, etc.)\nWith spending controls enabled, new transactions on Fiona's card will be approved/declined based on Fiona's balance. Since we haven't given her an allowance yet, her balance is zero! (as seen above)\nHint: click theNewbutton on the top right.\nNow that I've given Fiona an allowance, she can spend it with her card! This $2,500 didn't leave the organization's balance when I created an allowance. Instead, both balances will decrease when she makes a purchase.\nYou should probably also know that these allowances are not time-dependent. They don't expire, and they do not recur (it's not a weekly/monthly limit).\nAs a convenience, you can also choose to enable spending controls and set an initial amount when you invite someone to your organization.\nNeed to get somewhere quickly in HCB?

Five years ago, Hack Club HQ used Ledger to keep track of and open source all it's finances:https://github.com/hackclub/ledger. It became too much to maintain. When HQ itself began using HCB, we built Transparency Mode so that we could continue open sourcing our finances. That said, Ledger still is awesome. So now, if you'd like to use the Ledger CLI and are on HCB, you can export your transactions to the.ledgerfile format and have fun exploring your money in the terminal!\nAdditionally, you can also export the transactions of organisations with Transparency Mode enabled, check out HQ's finances:https://hcb.hackclub.com/exports/hq.ledger.\nHey folks!

If you have a special circumstance, please reach out– we are happy to talk through it with you.\np.s.

The “upload a receipt” link we email you has been totally redesigned for mobile, with the ability to take photos of your receipt directly from the page. If you’re uploading from a tablet or laptop, drag-and-drop is also supported.\nFinally, you don’t even have to open Bank– now you can reply to the “upload a receipt” emails with a photo or PDF of your receipt.

We'd love to hear your ideas, both for receipts and other features– be sure to leave us your feedback in Slack or via the Bank interface!\n\n– Caleb and Max\nA feature preview is live for users to try out:transfers between HCB accounts.\nPeople who are on multiple teams (ie. running a hackathon and running a club with separate accounts) can manage their money across accounts on Hack Club Bank.\n\nPreviously users would have to invoice themselves to move funds.

(🎺🎺 noises) I’m announcing my first ever feature contribution to Hack Club Bank. 🎉 On your homepage, after logging in, you can now use the section called\"Feedback\"to ... well I think you can guess ... submit any ideas you have for cool new features on Bank! As always, you can still continue to reach out to us on theHack Club Slackor byemail.\n\nFew things are as essential to the banking experience as photo IDs. You always gotta wait for the teller to get a real good look at you, and your ID, before making a transaction. (after all, you wouldn't want your near-identical evil twin stealing your hard-earned money)\nThe Hack Club Bank experience should feel as good or better than a physical IRL bank. Now,you can sign in using just your face (or fingerprint), on supported devices & browsers.\n\nCurrently, this includes modern versions ofGoogle Chrome,Safari, andEdge(as well assomeversionsof Firefox), but you can check for support on your current deviceusing this nifty website.\nHave a Yubikey? Guess what: Bank supports hardware security keys too!\nTo get set up, head on down to the brand newSecurity Keyssection of your Bank settings. You'll be enjoying faster sign-ins in no time!\nI hate passwords. I can neverremember them when I need them, each new account I create means another'unique' password, andpeople are great at leaking them. Wereallydon't want to burden everyone with all that just to access their financial platform, so now it's even easier to login to Hack Club Bank without a password.\nI'm happy to announce thatyou can now get login codes for Hack Club Bank via SMS.The feature can be enabled fromyour settings page.\n\nUsers on iPhone and some Android phones can autofill their SMS login code.\nYou can now get your passwordless login code that much faster– reducing login on some devices down to under 10 seconds.\nThis post is to explain the background details of our switch to Stripe Issuing. Accounts that need action to make the switch will receive an email.\nEmburse cards have been a feature since one of the earliest versions of Hack Club Bank, allowing any team member to spend money with a debit card without dealing with reimbursements. While that’s been amazing, there have been a few trade-offs with using Emburse:\nThese trade-offs made sense when we first started, but lots of details have changed in the last 2 years. Hack Club Bank has grown by…I started doing the math on this, but the comparison is stupid–our first year on Emburse has less than $1k spent per month, last week Bank users spent $20k through their cards. Emburse has been acquired (by a company that renamed to Emburse) & have shifted their product features.\nRecently Emburse announced they’d be removing the card budgeting feature Bank currently relies on. If we stayed on Emburse the new flow would require organizers to request funds for a purchase, staff (Michael / Chaleb) to approve the purchase amount, then the card could make the transaction. Emburse was super gracious about the change, delaying the budget feature removal long enough for us to switch to another platform.\nThe card alternative we’ve eyed for awhile is Stripe Issuing, but it was in private beta we couldn’t access when we built Hack Club Bank. At the time of writing, we’ve got a private version of Stripe Issuing cards running on Hack Club Bank (only available to admins) to make sure our new system works. I’m happy to say it improves many of the previous issues with cards:\nThis is obviously a big change, and if you have any questions/comments please let us know either by reaching out to bank@hackclub.com or posting in the#bankchannel on Slack.\n4 major improvements to Bank live today:\nAll of this is live for everyone now.

It’s limited to the first 500 people who claim it, so don’t wait.\nHope you’re safe & well. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reply & ask away!\nLast week, we launched a new feature in Hack Club Bank:Transparency Mode.\nWith Transparency Mode, you can open source your finances instantly from your account settings page. Why would you want to do that? Nonprofit donors deserve to know what their contributions are funding—as a hackathon/nonprofit, you can talk about what you’re spending money on, but transparency in every transaction builds trust for supporters. It’s already live in action!\nThat’s not all. When Hack Club first started, Zach’s hope was to build a different kind of organization: one not only open source with code, but open source with its finances too. Every month, Zach would painstaking put every transactionon GitHub. Unfortunately, as we grew, the tooling took too long & we had to outsource our books to an accounting firm that didn’t know what GitHub was.\nWe’ll be sharing this publicly next week, but Bank users are getting a sneak peek today:Hack Club HQ has been running entirely on Bank for months now, and our finances are public. Dig in, right here:bank.hackclub.com/hq.\nLet’s set a new standard in financial transparency for nonprofits. If you have any questions or feedback on how to improve Transparency Mode, please let us (bank@hackclub.com) know!\nToday, we’re announcing withMajor League Hackingthat Hack Club Bank is the new preferred financial platform for allMLH Member Events.\nWith this announcement,Cal Hacks, the world’s largest college hackathon, is announcing their switch to Hack Club Bank.Spectrais joining them as well.\nClick here to read Linus's full post on this announcement.\nBank can now predict the future! 🌀🎉\nIf you want to know when your invoices are coming in, or how much money is going to be automatically withdrawn from your account, Bank will now tell you.\nCheck it out by clicking on either \"Incoming Deposits\" or \"Pending Withdrawals\" on your Bank dashboard.\nIf you've ever wanted to get that old, unpaid invoice off of your invoices page, you now can.\nCheck it out by clicking \"Archive\" when you're viewing an invoice. 🚢🎉\nYou can now upload custom  profile pictures on Bank.\nCheck it out by navigating to the Team page and then selecting the settings icon next to your user. 🎉👌\nHave you been stuck with a lame URL likehttps://bank.hackclub.com/hack-pennsylvaniaand have wanted to change it to something likehttps://bank.hackclub.com/hackpenn?\nWell, now you can!\nCheck it out in the your Bank's settings. ✨ ⚡️\nWe've added a document to all projects that you can give to sponsors confirming that you're fiscally sponsored by Hack Club.\nCheck it out in your Documents tab! ✨☝️\nHave you ever wanted to attach an image or link to a transaction or invoice? Well, now with the addition ofMarkdown, you can.\nPower up your notes now! 🚀\nStarting today, there's no longer a fee for accepting credit cards, bank transfers, or any other payment method.\nYou've invoiced Balsamiq for $500, they paid via credit card, but you only received $485.20. Where'd that $14.80 go? Welcome to the world of payment processing. (HC Bank usesStripe)\nPayment processing fees are annoying. Calculating them ahead of time is frustrating and the result is alwayslessmoney for your event, club, or project.\nStarting today, Hack Club Bank will make all your payment processing fees disappear.\nThis means that regardless of whether a sponsor is paying via credit card, ACH, or wire, when you send an invoice for $500, you'll receive $500.\nAnd we're taking it even further.\nI'm proud to share we're also reimbursing all previous payment processing fees, from all time, for everyone.\nDepending on the size of past invoices, you'll receive somewhere between $4.48 and $390.50 (actual numbers) granted to your HC Bank account this week.\nIf you want to read more, check out ourblog post with the full story.\nP.S. We also resigned the invoice page to show you way more details.",

Along with changelog updates, we want to share more content online, like engineering deep-dives, our monthly newsletters, and more.\nWith this change, all of our posts are now open source and available on GitHub as well.\nWe're excited to share more with you in the future.

HCB now supports sending money to overseas bank accounts via an international wire:\nTo send an international wire, you'll need your recipient's bank's SWIFT code and account number as well as some country-specific information. Once you've got that, it's just like sending an ACH transfer to a US bank account on HCB.\nUnfortunately, wires are expensive to send. Our partner bank charges us $25 per wire; therefore, to keep HCB sustainable without passing this fee onto you, each wire sent must be at least $500. We've waived this requirement for organizations that have raised over $50k.\nIf you have any feedback on this wires feature, we'd love to hear from you! We're always looking to improve our product, and wires has been a difficult feature to polish.\nWhen we need help from you, we want to make sure we're reaching out to the right people.\nBy default, we'll email everyone who is a part of your team on HCB.

This introduced predetermined permission sets to control users' access in an organization.\nToday,we're introducing spending controls. This allows managers of HCB organizations to impose a finer level of control on how much money a member can spend.\nTo get to a team member's spending controls page, visit the Team page and click on the$icon next to their name.\nA team member's spending controls page gives you consolidated details of how they're using their cards.\nWhen controls are disabled, a member can spend any amount of money with their cards. (Since they're not managers, so still can't transfer via ACH, check, HCB transfer, etc.)\nWith spending controls enabled, new transactions on Fiona's card will be approved/declined based on Fiona's balance. Since we haven't given her an allowance yet, her balance is zero! (as seen above)\nHint: click theNewbutton on the top right.\nNow that I've given Fiona an allowance, she can spend it with her card! This $2,500 didn't leave the organization's balance when I created an allowance. Instead, both balances will decrease when she makes a purchase.\nYou should probably also know that these allowances are not time-dependent. They don't expire, and they do not recur (it's not a weekly/monthly limit).\nAs a convenience, you can also choose to enable spending controls and set an initial amount when you invite someone to your organization.\nNeed to get somewhere quickly in HCB?

Five years ago, Hack Club HQ used Ledger to keep track of and open source all it's finances:https://github.com/hackclub/ledger. It became too much to maintain. When HQ itself began using HCB, we built Transparency Mode so that we could continue open sourcing our finances. That said, Ledger still is awesome. So now, if you'd like to use the Ledger CLI and are on HCB, you can export your transactions to the.ledgerfile format and have fun exploring your money in the terminal!\nAdditionally, you can also export the transactions of organisations with Transparency Mode enabled, check out HQ's finances:https://hcb.hackclub.com/exports/hq.ledger.\nHey folks! We've got two brand new bits of info to share with you all. First, Hack Club Bank isgrowing— we just hit 💸 $10,000,000 💸 in total transactions for fiscally sponsored organizations! Go you! (and this doesn't even include Hack Club's money!)\nSecond bit of news: the government has some rules about who can— and cannot— call themselves a bank. Now that we've grown a LOT, it's time to change the way we refer to ourselves. As of today,we're shortening our name to HCB.\nTo celebrate, here are 10 acronyms for HCB:\nWe can now be found athcb.hackclub.com,hackclub.com/hcb,hcb@hackclub.com, and so on. Not to fret, though; all of your old links will redirect, and we can still be reached at our old email.\nWe're still the same ol' fiscal sponsor you know and love, just with a few fewer letters.New name, same great taste!\nTired of having transactions declined because you accidentally put in your address instead of ours? Now you can edit your billing address (and update payment information accordingly) wherever you Bank!\n\nSay goodbye to baring the heavy prestige of Fiona Hackworth III, and just be known as Fiona!\nWhile we are required to collect legal names for compliance, most places on Hack Club Bank will now just show your preferred name (if set).\nGo to your settings and set your preferred name today!\n\nHi HCB users!

Orgs with donor funding will be prioritized for open slots.\nNow, when you share links from Hack Club Bank on social media or messaging apps, you'll see a preview image accompanying the link, providing the world with an eye-catching window into your organization’s finances.\n\nAt Hack Club Bank, pushing for financial transparency is one of our primary goals.

Just snap a picture, wait a day or two, and watch the funds roll into your account.\n\nThis feature is available now for everyone.

Ignore it every week and now that 1-2 receipts has grown into a much larger number?\nFor those extra receipts, you can now opt-into a receipt report email onyour feature previews page.\nThis just in: Hack Club Bank accounts now have account/routing numbers, which means you can receive payouts from platforms like Shopify and Venmo!\nHere are some cool things you can do with account numbers:\nYou can receive money from any platform that asks for an account/routing number. For security, your account number is deposit-only: you can't withdraw money using it.\nThis is live for everyone right now— check out the new \"Account/routing number\" page in your sidebar and start receiving money!\n\nFundraising for your nonprofit or hackathon is hard, and takes time away from actually using the donated money. What if the funds could raise themselves?\nTo fix this, I added a monthly subscription option to your organization's donation page— now when a donor sends a payment, they can opt-in to make their donation monthly. No more manually sending invoices every month.\n\nHere'smy own org'smonthly donation page!\nThis feature is live for everyone right now— you don't need to opt-in. You can see your recurring donors in your dashboard's Donations tab:\n\nHope this helps you spend less time fundraising, and more time doing whatever it is your nonprofit does.\nAs of today you can test out a new preview feature:SMS notifications when you swipe your card.\nEmails aren't always immediate, and when you're dashing through the checkout line at Costco while stocking up on breakfast for your hackathon 2 minutes could be the difference between remembering to take a photo of your receipt or  throwing it away entirely.\nNow with SMS notifications, you'll get this:\n\nWhen you use your card in-person, you'll get a text with a link to upload your receipt. You can opt-in to the feature preview from yourfeature previewspage.\nIn the future we can add the ability to reply directly to the text with a photo of your receipt.\nYou can name your card to help keep everything organized (eg. General Spending, Online Retailers, Amazon). Renameyour cardsby clicking on the edit name button when viewing your card.\n\nYour homepage is now a bit more customizable— if you're a member of several organizations on Bank, you can now change their order just by dragging them around!\n\nHey all! Today hackathon grants are live.\nIn case you missed it, we’re distributing $500 grants for IRL high school hackathons with the help ofFIRST.\nIf you're planning to run your own,check it out.\nAdditionally, we’re waiving the 7% fee for IRL high school hackathons until Dec 31st.

The first grant hasalready gone out!\n\nRenaming transactions is a great way to organize your finances on Hack Club Bank. It also helps team members and supporters to understand how your organization's money is spent. Upon renaming a transaction, you'll now be provided with a dropdown list of suggestions based on similar, previous transactions in your transaction history!\n\nDonations and invoices now deposit in the time it takes for you to read this sentence.\nWith many financial systems, money can take up to two weeks to move. But now on Hack Club Bank, gone are the days when you had to wait.

You now have access to a simplified, custom form in your “Perks” tab, and once submitted, Bank team will provide you with a custom quote.

This includes transaction history like checks, ACHs, invoices, transfers, donations, as well as organizations and their respective team members.\nThis API will pave the way for more applications likeSlack Club Bank,HackPenn's financial visualization, and your next amazing project. We can't wait to see what you ship!\n\nIf you run into any bugs or have any feedback, please let us know at bank@hackclub.com!\n— Ella, Caleb, and Gary\nHave you ever wanted to change your organization's URL?

It's like magic.\nYou can change your organization's URL by clicking \"Settings\" in the sidebar. Happy hacking!\n\nStarting today, Hack Club Bank will be sending out seasonal newsletters to share about new features, transparent orgs, and other awesome announcements. 🎉 Feel free toreach out to meif you didn't receive the summer edition and would like to be added!\n\nThe financial system in the US isa little slow. In personal finance, that's annoying. For a hackathon organizer who needs tobuy50+burritoswhile herding ~~cats~~ attendees & dodging taxis in NYC, slow money transfers is too much.\nAs of todaywe've improved our account transfers beta to instantly add to your balance.\nDonations usually take 3-5 days from a donor swiping their card to finally arriving in your account. Hackathon organizers often zero out their balance while waiting for a donation payment to arrive.\nYou can nowrequest afrontfor paid funds that are still in transit– if your event is happening within 7 days we'll lend you the funds viaan  instant transfer from us, to you. Once the event is over we'll transfer the funds back out of your account.\nEligible invoices and donations have a button to request a front:\n\nKeep in mind we can only front funds that we can confirm paid (ie. they swiped their card successfully, but the funds haven't arrived yet), and we may take up to 24 hours to get your request. Although we're focusing on hackathons running within 7 days, we know everyone has a different story. If you have a special circumstance, please reach out– we are happy to talk through it with you.\np.s. Users who enabled theaccount transfer betawill also find their transfers reflect in their budgets immediately, instead of the 3-4 days that it used to take.\nLittle update to the donation form: donors can now contribute to your project using Apple Pay! This feature is now available to all organizations running on Hack Club Bank.\n\nToday we're shipping 3 major improvements to the receipt uploading experience on Hack Club Bank!\nYour receipts pageis now smarter– just click \"Add a receipt\" or drag & drop a file to instantly attach your receipt. We've also fixed a bug that caused declined & refunded transactions to show up, even though they don't need receipts.The transaction details page has drag & drop, too– just drop a file anywhere to upload a receipt to that transaction.\nIn a busy checkout line? The “upload a receipt” link we email you has been totally redesigned for mobile, with the ability to take photos of your receipt directly from the page. If you’re uploading from a tablet or laptop, drag-and-drop is also supported.\nFinally, you don’t even have to open Bank– now you can reply to the “upload a receipt” emails with a photo or PDF of your receipt. This is especially useful if you have limited bandwidth and can't load the site.\nWhat's next– receipt upload via direct brain connection? We'd love to hear your ideas, both for receipts and other features– be sure to leave us your feedback in Slack or via the Bank interface!\n\n– Caleb and Max\nA feature preview is live for users to try out:transfers between HCB accounts.\nPeople who are on multiple teams (ie. running a hackathon and running a club with separate accounts) can manage their money across accounts on Hack Club Bank.\n\nPreviously users would have to invoice themselves to move funds. Besides the 7% fee on those funds, it would take between 5-7 days for funds to show up.Transfers cut the time in half and changes \"fee\" to \"free\".\nYou can enable the betain your account settings. Please send me your feedback!\nA new feature preview is available for users to opt-into. Once enabled, you can reply to the automated \"upload your receipt\" emails with your receipt directly– no need to click any links.\n\nYou can enable the previewin your account settings. Please send me your feedback!\n\n1Password is providing $100 USD of credit to all organizations on Hack Club Bank.

Don’t hesitate to reach out via email to bank@hackclub.com or in the#bankchannel on Slack if you have any questions or feedback.\nWe've just rolled out a set of changes around card charges to give a better understanding of where a transaction came from.\n\nEach of these charges are onHack Club HQ.\nHey everyone! (🎺🎺 noises) I’m announcing my first ever feature contribution to Hack Club Bank. 🎉 On your homepage, after logging in, you can now use the section called\"Feedback\"to ... well I think you can guess ... submit any ideas you have for cool new features on Bank! As always, you can still continue to reach out to us on theHack Club Slackor byemail.\n\nFew things are as essential to the banking experience as photo IDs. You always gotta wait for the teller to get a real good look at you, and your ID, before making a transaction. (after all, you wouldn't want your near-identical evil twin stealing your hard-earned money)\nThe Hack Club Bank experience should feel as good or better than a physical IRL bank. Now,you can sign in using just your face (or fingerprint), on supported devices & browsers.\n\nCurrently, this includes modern versions ofGoogle Chrome,Safari, andEdge(as well assomeversionsof Firefox), but you can check for support on your current deviceusing this nifty website.\nHave a Yubikey? Guess what: Bank supports hardware security keys too!\nTo get set up, head on down to the brand newSecurity Keyssection of your Bank settings. You'll be enjoying faster sign-ins in no time!\nI hate passwords. I can neverremember them when I need them, each new account I create means another'unique' password, andpeople are great at leaking them. Wereallydon't want to burden everyone with all that just to access their financial platform, so now it's even easier to login to Hack Club Bank without a password.\nI'm happy to announce thatyou can now get login codes for Hack Club Bank via SMS.The feature can be enabled fromyour settings page.\n\nUsers on iPhone and some Android phones can autofill their SMS login code.\nYou can now get your passwordless login code that much faster– reducing login on some devices down to under 10 seconds.\nThis post is to explain the background details of our switch to Stripe Issuing. Accounts that need action to make the switch will receive an email.\nEmburse cards have been a feature since one of the earliest versions of Hack Club Bank, allowing any team member to spend money with a debit card without dealing with reimbursements. While that’s been amazing, there have been a few trade-offs with using Emburse:\nThese trade-offs made sense when we first started, but lots of details have changed in the last 2 years. Hack Club Bank has grown by…I started doing the math on this, but the comparison is stupid–our first year on Emburse has less than $1k spent per month, last week Bank users spent $20k through their cards. Emburse has been acquired (by a company that renamed to Emburse) & have shifted their product features.\nRecently Emburse announced they’d be removing the card budgeting feature Bank currently relies on. If we stayed on Emburse the new flow would require organizers to request funds for a purchase, staff (Michael / Chaleb) to approve the purchase amount, then the card could make the transaction. Emburse was super gracious about the change, delaying the budget feature removal long enough for us to switch to another platform.\nThe card alternative we’ve eyed for awhile is Stripe Issuing, but it was in private beta we couldn’t access when we built Hack Club Bank. At the time of writing, we’ve got a private version of Stripe Issuing cards running on Hack Club Bank (only available to admins) to make sure our new system works. I’m happy to say it improves many of the previous issues with cards:\nThis is obviously a big change, and if you have any questions/comments please let us know either by reaching out to bank@hackclub.com or posting in the#bankchannel on Slack.\n4 major improvements to Bank live today:\nAll of this is live for everyone now. More to come! 👀\nThanks to our generous friends over at repl.it, in light of COVID-19,Hack Club Bank users get a free Hacker plan for the next year.

It’s limited to the first 500 people who claim it, so don’t wait.\nHope you’re safe & well. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reply & ask away!\nLast week, we launched a new feature in Hack Club Bank:Transparency Mode.\nWith Transparency Mode, you can open source your finances instantly from your account settings page. Why would you want to do that? Nonprofit donors deserve to know what their contributions are funding—as a hackathon/nonprofit, you can talk about what you’re spending money on, but transparency in every transaction builds trust for supporters. It’s already live in action!\nThat’s not all. When Hack Club first started, Zach’s hope was to build a different kind of organization: one not only open source with code, but open source with its finances too. Every month, Zach would painstaking put every transactionon GitHub. Unfortunately, as we grew, the tooling took too long & we had to outsource our books to an accounting firm that didn’t know what GitHub was.\nWe’ll be sharing this publicly next week, but Bank users are getting a sneak peek today:Hack Club HQ has been running entirely on Bank for months now, and our finances are public. Dig in, right here:bank.hackclub.com/hq.\nLet’s set a new standard in financial transparency for nonprofits. If you have any questions or feedback on how to improve Transparency Mode, please let us (bank@hackclub.com) know!\nToday, we’re announcing withMajor League Hackingthat Hack Club Bank is the new preferred financial platform for allMLH Member Events.\nWith this announcement,Cal Hacks, the world’s largest college hackathon, is announcing their switch to Hack Club Bank.Spectrais joining them as well.\nClick here to read Linus's full post on this announcement.\nBank can now predict the future! 🌀🎉\nIf you want to know when your invoices are coming in, or how much money is going to be automatically withdrawn from your account, Bank will now tell you.\nCheck it out by clicking on either \"Incoming Deposits\" or \"Pending Withdrawals\" on your Bank dashboard.\nIf you've ever wanted to get that old, unpaid invoice off of your invoices page, you now can.\nCheck it out by clicking \"Archive\" when you're viewing an invoice. 🚢🎉\nYou can now upload custom  profile pictures on Bank.\nCheck it out by navigating to the Team page and then selecting the settings icon next to your user. 🎉👌\nHave you been stuck with a lame URL likehttps://bank.hackclub.com/hack-pennsylvaniaand have wanted to change it to something likehttps://bank.hackclub.com/hackpenn?\nWell, now you can!\nCheck it out in the your Bank's settings. ✨ ⚡️\nWe've added a document to all projects that you can give to sponsors confirming that you're fiscally sponsored by Hack Club.\nCheck it out in your Documents tab! ✨☝️\nHave you ever wanted to attach an image or link to a transaction or invoice? Well, now with the addition ofMarkdown, you can.\nPower up your notes now! 🚀\nStarting today, there's no longer a fee for accepting credit cards, bank transfers, or any other payment method.\nYou've invoiced Balsamiq for $500, they paid via credit card, but you only received $485.20. Where'd that $14.80 go? Welcome to the world of payment processing. (HC Bank usesStripe)\nPayment processing fees are annoying. Calculating them ahead of time is frustrating and the result is alwayslessmoney for your event, club, or project.\nStarting today, Hack Club Bank will make all your payment processing fees disappear.\nThis means that regardless of whether a sponsor is paying via credit card, ACH, or wire, when you send an invoice for $500, you'll receive $500.\nAnd we're taking it even further.\nI'm proud to share we're also reimbursing all previous payment processing fees, from all time, for everyone.\nDepending on the size of past invoices, you'll receive somewhere between $4.48 and $390.50 (actual numbers) granted to your HC Bank account this week.\nIf you want to read more, check out ourblog post with the full story.\nP.S. We also resigned the invoice page to show you way more details.",

        "content": "We focus a lot on software at Hack Club. It’s soft, after all. This summer we left our comfort zone. Global pandemic—generally a bad start to summer—left us with$50k of unused grant money from GitHub. We thought about saving it. Instead we gave it away to students as a kind of fun experiment:distributing hardware to teenage makers with cool project ideas. One thing we liked about hardware grants was that bits—however magical—are ultimately constrained by atoms. It seemed right to connect over building physical things during a summer when personal connections relied on the internet more than ever.\nEllen Xu, a 15-year-old from San Diego, made a machine learning algorithm to run on a Raspberry Pi to help people diagnose Kawasaki disease, the #1 heart disease in children in the U.S. & Japan.\nAs part of Summer of Making we builtScrapbook. The idea:share updates of what you’re working on every day.So as Hack Clubbers are learning & building projects, short video or photo updates go into a Slack channel. Through a Slack bot, an Airtable, & a Next.js website making everything browsable, we made a sitefull of amazing things built this summer.\nLimor Fried\nDylan Field\nTommy DeVoss\nAlex Stamos\nNicky Case\nThanks to COVID-19, this summer was like no other with so many teenagers stuck at home. From treasure hunts to late night Zoom hangouts to a mini hackathon, the community was filled with fun events. Alongside events, the Slack served as a global makerspace (open 24/7) where hackers could hang out.\nThank you: Sam Poder, Lachlan Campbell, Zach Latta, Roshan Palakkal, Neel Redkar, Matthew Stanciu, Chris Walker, Max Wofford, Athul Blesson, Amogh Chaubey, Dina Elhanan, Chaleb Pommells, Annlee Fores, Michael Destefanis, Melody & Christina Asquith.\nRecap site by@sampoder.

You wonder what she might say...\nToriel is a fork ofClippy.\nContributions are encouraged and welcome!\nIn order to run Toriel locally, you'll need tojoin the Hack Club Slack.

Similar to the role that #in-the-cave plays for Toriel (runtoriel-restartin slack to see what this means).\nEdittranscript.yml.

For example, if your channel ismsw-test-cavewith the channel idCDF1A5EG865, you would add:\nYou can find the channel ID by opening the channel and clicking on the channel name in the top left.

If the channel is private, you can create a new private channel as its substitute, but remember to update the references in the code. Ex.#toriels-diaryis a private channel, so you can create#msw-toriels-diary, add it totranscript.yml, and change all{channels.toriels-diary}to{channels.msw-toriels-diary}.\nNote: you have to re-update the Underpass tunnel URL on the Slack app manifest and verify the URL each time to restart the server, since the tunnel URL changes\nFormattingis important, please runnpm run fmton contribution.\n👋 A friendly bot that assists new members with joining Hack Club",

        "content": "Hack CampbyHack Club\nA 1-week summer campto get started coding.\nJuly 2019 · Grades 8–12 · San Francisco, CA\nApplications are now closed!\nComputers give us superpowers. Anyone, anywhere, can create beautiful things and solve real problems for people everywhere.\nLearning to code is your way into this world. Crossing this bridge unlocks the power to make stories, drawings, or wires into websites, games, robots, and things nobody but you imagine.\nIt’s not about learning a programming framework—it’s about learning to teach yourself. Best of all, you can join a worldwide community of people doing the same. This is Hacker Culture, & it brings out the best in us all.\nJust to be clear: we don’t break in to internet banks. Some hackers specialize in cybersecurity; we’re not especially focused on it.\nEvery day at Hack Camp you’ll go home with a new finished project. We want some projects to be a surprise, but here are a few you’ll certainly tackle:\nA teenager in our community built the website you’re reading from scratch. The first day, it’ll be your turn.\nRadios are the basis of Wi-Fi & satellites. You’ll build one yourself—but with a pencil, razor blade, & copper wire.\nMaking a game is a great intro to code, and it’s never been easier. You’ll go home with your own 3D world.\nMorning discussion\nWhat are we doing today?\nMorning workshop\nLet’s build something awesome together.\nLunch\nAfternoon workshop\nProgress resumes on incredible stuff.\nProject demos\nWoah, you built that today??\nCamp dismissed\nHack Camp was the single factor that completely shifted my view of CS. I met an unbelievably accepting & kind community of creators & learners that introduced me to an entirely novel approach to hacking, changing not just the way I regard technology, but the way I approach the world at large.\nHack Camp attendee, 2016\nWe’reHack Club, a global nonprofit network of high school coding clubs (now in 2% of US high schools). Hack Camp has been a part of Hack Club since the beginning. It’s a great way for us to try out the best ideas from our community, develop curriculum, and stay sharp as teachers. We also just love doing it!\nFernanda is a student of computational neuroscience, entrepreneur, and organizer with years of experience running events and programs like the Entrepreneurial Learning Academy for students in Mexico. This summer, she’ll run Hack Camp’s logistics and be your primary contact.\nMingjie is a student organizer who has spread his passion for technology to thousands of other students through events like Hack Chicago, CodeDay, and his own Hack Club. This summer he’s working with club leaders around the world to build the ultimate curriculum.\nChris is an all-around hacker enthusiast passionate about building video games, websites, radios, furniture, rockets, fire sculptures, communities, and more! He will be leading Hack Camp’s workshops, designing hardware projects, and directing the day-to-day experience.\nHack Camp began as an experiment to discover new ways of teaching coding at our clubs around the world.\nAfter our first year, something incredible happened—our students began running their own camps! They’ve sprung up in a suburb of Cincinnati & Southern India.\nThis was so inspiring to watch that we’re following their lead to bring Hack Camp back in 2019.\n2015\nHack Club is born\n2015\nFirst Hack Camp in SF\n2016\nSF Hack Camp v2\n2017\nA Camp appears in Mason, OH\n2018\nCamp runs again in Mason\n2018\nA Camp appears in Kerala, India\n2019\nHack Camp returns to HQ!\nHack Camp is a chance for young students to discover their ability to build using code. Your youth is the most defining time of your life, and Hack Camp helped us reach out to students around the community to expose them to the most beautiful, empowering parts of technology.\nCamp leader, Harvard ’23\nI was worried campers might lose interest since coding was new to them. But when we got them started, they blew us away. They started learning by themselves during the camp and built things we never taught them.\nCamp leader, ASIET ’21\nWe’re running Hack Camp right at our office in San Francisco (576 Natoma St). Here’s the space.\nWe’re running three identical weeks of Hack Camp. Join us July 1–5th, 15–19th, or July 29th–August 2nd. Camp runs 9am–4pm (weekdays).\nJuly 2019\nNeed-based financial aid is available for Hack Camp after you apply.\nLunch is! We’ll serve a healthy lunch & snacks every day at Camp.\nPerfect! You’ll be up to speed in no time. We made this with beginners in mind.\nWe will cover lots of stuff you don’t know yet—I guarantee it!\nA laptop and an open mind. We can help with the laptop. The mind thing is on you.\nAbout 15 students each. We’re shooting for a 5:1 student-to-instructor ratio.\nSadly we can’t offer official housing, but you’re welcome to find your own & come!\nPlease reach out!

        "content": "We'll be building generative art today!\nHey y'all! We're going to be running another HC meeting today in, of course, room 322. I thought it would be nice for us to take a break from Sprig (personally, I'm almost finished with a Sprig game so I'll hopefully get to bring in a console next week or the week after to show you guys) because people are having trouble with it, so I thought we could learn JavaScript by building Tic-Tac-Toe! Hopefully the code we've written in Sprig will make more sense after today. (Let me know if you're building a game with Sprig! I absolutely want to see it. Email me all hours of the day if you need help.)\nOther news. PRs for Winter Wonderland closed a few days ago. Did you guys submit anything? Let me know! I'm going to be turning my bike into an electric bike, which I think is super cool!\nI have one last question -IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO WITH PROGRAMMING? Let me know and I can totally run a meeting on it (whatever you want... building a game, working with ChatGPT, building a chat app... whatever's fun for you!)\nHey there! Here's what we're going to be doing today:\nSigning up for Slack is another very important thing we need to do.Everyone's going to go home and add their Google Account to their Chromebooks, which should then allow you guys to sign up for Slack while we're running a club meeting. Let me know if there are any problems!\nSome other news:\n\nSince it's the last meeting of the year, we're having a pizza party! Here's what we're going to be doing today. I've decided to try out slotting everything into times:\nI don't think we'll finish the holiday card during the meeting, but I will have it deployed by the end of Monday! Then, you guys can share it with whoever you want to share it with.\nOther news:\nHey guys! We'll be running a meeting today in room 322. I'll help some of you guys with the Sprig workshop, and the rest of you guys can keep working on your games!Also, please take a look at the questions I asked in the December 5 post.\nIn the meantime, what kind of games are you guys working on? Or leave a \"IDK\" if you don't know yet.\nIt's another Monday, so we'll be running a meeting in room 322! We've started working on our Sprig games; I'm in the process of writing a cheatsheet that's going to explain the Sokoban game we created line by line so you guys can understand it better.\nIf you weren't here last week, that's okay! I can go over the steps to finish your games one by one, and then you can start building your games! Some useful resources include:\nLast but not least, HC news this week:\nAnd I have a couple of questions:\nHey, we'll be running a meeting today in room 322! We're going to finish our Sprig games, and then we can probably start building our own games next week! Exciting. Other news:\nHack Club is canceled.\nWe're running a meeting in room 322 again! This time, I'm going to switch things up a bit - we're going to be building games for the Sprig console! Sprig is a gaming console built by members of HC - it's built with the Raspberry Pi Pico (https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) and anybody who builds a game for it can get a console, which you can use to play games on or repurpose and take apart! For more info and to play some games built by other Hack Clubbers, check out this link:https://sprig.hackclub.com/\nWe're going to learn how to build a basic game for the Sprig together (I don't know anything about it either), and then we'll each build a game (or more) over the next three weeks or so! At least, that's the plan.\nAlso, I started a playlist here:https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3APoczNOrVwbAVeYRWGhyf. Please tell me what to include! I have been told by people that I have horrible taste in music, so do not trust me to put together a good playlist.\nOther news:\nHey, we're going to be running a meeting today! Let's meet in room 322. We'll be working on the same thing - building websites.\nWhat are you guys planning to build for your websites? Just share the link to your Replit below. And if you're not there yet, it's okay! Please let me know if the workshop is too hard for you - I'll be more than happy to help! Plus, if you want to add stuff like fonts, columns, etc. to your website, let me know.\nHave no ideas on what kind of website to build? Also let me know, I've got a couple of ideas!\nNews of the week:\nKept working on our websites! We had to move to room 322 since ISSN wasn't open.\nFirst meeting! We had donuts and started learning HTML and CSS.",

        "content": "A Hackathon is a social coding event—and Days of Service is Hack Club's initiative to support girls learning to code by hosting gender-focused Hackathons as an opportunity for girls to build awesome projects!\nWorking with local youth organizations, high school Hack Club leaders run one-day coding events (a day of service) that help girls and gender minorities write their first lines of code. They might build their first ever website, video game, application, or even code a robot arm to draw out their sketches!\nBuilt for beginners learning to code, girls are supported by experienced Hack Clubbers. By the end of the day, every single participant builds something with code. In 2023, Hack Club girls ran Days of Service in 6 cities, and in 2024 they'll increase events to more than 10 cities.\nA track is a series of workshops for a specific coding subject that you will learn about during the hackathon!\nIn this workshop, participants will learn to create computer-generated art by drawing assorted shapes from our guides. They'll useBlot, a robotic arm created by Hack Club that translates code to creation. With this track, attendees will learn JavaScript and digitial fabrication. Afterwards, they'll be shipped their own robot arm to draw what they've created!\nIn this workshop, participants will learn the fundamentals of circuit board design with Hack Club'sOnBoard program. They'll useEasyEDA, a circuit design software, to complete this. Attendees will learn to use that software as well as the basics of PCB design. After students complete this track, they'll be shipped their PCB to have a physical copy of their creation!\nIn this workshop, participants learn the fundamentals of 3D modeling by building their own 3D village. They'll useSpline, a web-based 3D design tool, to accomplish this. Spline allows them to add interactivity and customize their design. With this track, attendees learn the basics of working in 3D, which can be used for websites, games, animation, and printing!\nAttendance is free thanks to Hack Club's support!\nEvergreen is a Days of Service event that aims to teach teens how to code and build their own projects.\nThat's perfectly okay! We will have workshops to teach you!\nYou should bring a laptop, but we will have Chromebooks available if you don't have a laptop.\nYou can work by yourself or in a team! The goal is to create something that you're proud of.\nEvergreen will take place at the Amazon HQ in Seattle.\nThat's totally okay! Any high schooler can attend.\nNo worries!

I also love diving into the unknown, learning new technologies, and applying them in creative ways to make a difference.\nPeople often ask, “If money wasn’t a factor, what would you do?” My answer’s always the same: I’d still be here, working with computers and pushing forward in development. For me, this field isn’t just a career; it’s what makes me tick. When I’m not geeking out over code, you’ll probably find me brainstorming new ideas, diving into strategic planning, or just exploring how technology shapes the world around us.\nTHAT'S HOW MUCH I LOVE WHAT I DO !\nNew Brunswick, NJ\nVadodara | Gujarat, India\nInstitution: CodeAlpha\nYear: Jan. 2024 - Jan. 2024\nDetails: Focused on software development based on Python\nInstitution: Leadership Initiatives\nYear: Aug 2023 - Mar 2024\nDetails: Helped small Business Owners in Bauchi, Nigeria to incubate their local Business from ground-up.\nInstitution: Internshala\nYear: Aug 2023 - Dec 2023\nDetails: Face of Company on Campus.\nInstitution: International Model United Nations Association (IMUNA)\nYear: Jul 2023 - Sep 2023\nDetails: Helped students increase awarness and participation in MUNs.\nInstitution: WaySpire\nYear: Dec 2023 - Mar 2024\nDetails: Face of Company on Campus, helping students break into tech,learning from, top instutions like IITs.\n© 2025 Made with ♡ by Aryan Patel",

If you’re a member of multiple HCB organizations, it can be hard telling your cards apart.\nI’ve started writing the organization name on the back of mine:\n\nWe’ve got a more elegant solution for you all, however. You can now customise the logo printed in the top right and we’ve started printing the organization name on the card:\n\n(Apexis a high-altitude balloon-forcused hackathon running on HCB!)\nPlus, we’ve got white cards now. Fancy.\n\nIt's that time of year again! We know you've been hard at work on your nonprofit projects, and we want to celebrate the achievements you've made in 2024. That's why we're excited to announce HCB Wrapped 2024, your year in review!\n\nCheck it out here:hcb.hackclub.com/wrapped\nWe hope you enjoy it. Happy holidays! 🎉\nNote:You need to have access to the Google Workspace perk on HCB to use this feature\nHave you ever needed to have multiple emails for your organization (like help@, sponsor@, [your name]@)?\nPreviously, you would have had to create a new account for each address, but you no longer need to.\nOn HCB, you can now create up to 30 aliases per Google Workspace account; all emails to an alias will be sent to its parent account's inbox. No more having to flip through 10 different inboxes!\n\nToday we're launching a new way to stay up-to-date on HCB:our new blog.\nFor as long as I can remember, HCB has been usingHeadwayto announce product updates and changes to users, but over time our needs have shifted. Along with changelog updates, we want to share more content online, like engineering deep-dives, our monthly newsletters, and more.\nWith this change, all of our posts are now open source and available onGitHubas well.\nWe're excited to share more with you in the future. Stay tuned!\nFor a long time, HCB cards appeared as a mysterious, dark, unbranded card in your Apple Wallet.\n\nToday, we're excited to announce that it's getting a new look! Some people might say it's fresh & crisp, just like a juicy apple 🍎. Enjoy!\n\nThanks to Ian and Sam for the design work!\nExciting news for organizations doing work outside the US! HCB now supports sending money to overseas bank accounts via an international wire:\n\nTo send an international wire, you'll need your recipient's bank's SWIFT code and account number as well as some country-specific information. Once you've got that, it's just like sending an ACH transfer to a US bank account on HCB.\nUnfortunately, wires are expensive to send. Our partner bank charges us $25 per wire; therefore, to keep HCB sustainable without passing this fee onto you, each wire sent must be at least $500. We've waived this requirement for organizations that have raised over $50k.\nWhen we need help from you, we want to make sure we're reaching out to the right people.\nBy default, we'll email everyone who is a part of your team on HCB. However, if you have a shared team email or would prefer for us to reach out to a specific email, you can now let us know:\n\nAre you trying to manually link your organization'saccount & routing numberswith a 3rd party service? Sometimes these services will ask for a bank account letter that proves you have access to your account number.\nLuckily for you, sitting right on your documents page is averification letteryou can share. ✨✅\nThis handy one-pager allows organizations on HCB to prove they have access to their account & routing numbers.\n\nLooking for a little bit of extra security? You can now turn on two-factor authentication for your account:\n\nThat'll prompt you for two authentication factors each time you log in, whether it's a hardware security key, a login code sent to your email/phone, or a time-based one time password.\nYou know what they say about 2FA, you may find it mildly annoying but baddies find it infuriating.Ok, no one says that but you get the point.\nAre you a part of multiple organizations on HCB? Simply click on your organization's title to navigate between them! 🔥\n",

Sometimes it's hard to keep track of which apps are making calls to airtable, and consuming the global airtable ratelimit. A common problem we run into is that one of our apps start to hit the limit with faulty retry logic, then bottleneck all of our services at once.\nMiddleman is a way to pipe all of our airtable requests through one location so we can track which apps are the most noisy.\nHere's how you use it:\nYou can just swap out your calls fromhttps://api.airtable.com/v0/apitohttps://middleman.hackclub.com/airtable/v0/api. For example:\nPlease also set yourUser-Agentto something specific to your app! The whole point of this is to hunt down apps that are having trouble and we can't do that if we can't tell who you are!\nAirtable.js's persistent retry logic is why we built this in the first place, so we don't really recommend using it. If you must though, it already has some built-in ways to handle this.\nYou can just setAIRTABLE_ENDPOINT_URL=\"https://middleman.hackclub.com/airtable\"\nWe deploy using fly.io using ourGitHub action.

Code together, find your programming community, dream up something wild, or just #lounge.\n\nOccasionally we invite someone we really want to speak to (like Sal Khan, George Hotz, and Lady Ada) and host an AMA with them.\nHURRY UP NOW!JOIN THE HACK CLUB MOVEMENT",
