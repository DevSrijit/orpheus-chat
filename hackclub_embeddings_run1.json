Or rather, not normal. This is the first Saturday in a while where she can lie in bed alone, look out the window, and daydream about whatever she wants to. No tea parties to go to, no meetings, no nothing. She can just lie in bed and think about pancakes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\nWhat a perfect day. You know what would be even more perfect? Actual pancakes. Blueberry pancakes, chocolate pancakes, banana pancakes. That means she has got to get out of bed and check if she has those ingredients. She rolls over and out of bed and into the kitchen.\nWhen she gets to the kitchen, there's a knock on the door. Now, Orpheus' house is laid out in such a way that the front door leads to the kitchen. Or rather, the kitchen leads to the front door. (The magic of perspective.)\nI know when you read this you will be most suspicious of me, the narrator. Trust me. I am not the mysterious person that you will learn about later. I just happen to be omnipresent.\nPerfect timing!, she thinks.Almost like someone knows what I'm doing at the current moment.\nThe doorbell rings insistently again. Orpheusrunsstomps her way over to the door and opens it, but no one's there! She looks around. Nobody's around. It's kind of a dull and gray day outside, honestly, although the rain is making nice pitter-patter sounds on the porch screens.\nShe looks down. There's a box at her feet. Ooh. Could it be fan mail? She bends down to pick it up.\nYes, Orpheus gets fan mail. If you want to send her some after reading this\nyou can send them to 15 Falls Road, Shelburne VT 05482.\nShe rips apart the box with her claws, and three things fall out: a keyboard sort of thing with a very small screen (a computer??), a grid-like boxy sort of contraption (something like this.Orpheus and I couldn't come up with a better description when we were arguing over the sequence of events), and a nice, fancy piece of paper that Orpheus can't help but put her nose up to. It smells good. Like paper, you know?\nOrpheus reads the letter.\nI hope this letter finds you well. Maybe on a cozy rainy Saturday morning. In the confines of this package (there is only so much you can fit inside a decent package when you are trying to adhere to USPS shipping guidelines while also trying to be budget-friendly), there are two things: a computer unlike anything you normally use, for interfacing with the second thing, an easel.\nThe easel is a blank, sad thing right now. You need to paint it. Now, you can't paint it with any normal paint and brush. What, do you think this is, that one boy with that one purple crayon that he can just make random shite come to life with by scribbling?\nNo,you must talk to it.\nI know you've wanted to be an artist. And now you have a chance to be a special one. An artist who can also perform magic! Figure out how to talk to the easel with the computer I have provided, and you can do both. Hint: you need to write a programming language. The one I have included is called Easel, and is a good starting point.\nThere is much you'll learn along the way. You might even find that there's a surprise or two, too. (See what I did there? Punny. Yes, I am quite a humorous person. It is something I pride myself on. Quite masterful at pranks, too.)\nYou'll probably go back to cooking pancakes or something. There are many reasons to do this, though, and here I'll rank them in alphabetical order:\nFrom the narrator: programming language idea? Star Wars-based programming language? Very based. (I heard that's the hip word nowadays.)\nSigned,\nyour mysterious sender\nP.S. I know that you would like to know who I am because who doesn't? So let's strike a compromise. Once you figure out how to paint this easel, you'll be able to run this:\nAnd figure out who I am.\nOrpheus is slightly taken aback. Erm, crepey. Sorry, creepy. Her stomach rumbles. Sorry. Just a little bit hungry. How does this mysterious sender know everything that is happening, in real time? Guess the only way to find out is to write that programming language.\nHm. Orpheus could go cook pancakes, or she could figure out this easel and who in the hecktie-neckties this mysterious person is. Or she could do both.\nShe's never written a programming language before, but then, I presume you haven't, either. This is an invitation for you to join Orpheus' pancake party.\nGo cook your pancakes! We'll be back in half an hour.\nThese are the recipes we used. I found them in one of Orpheus' many drawers, but I don't think it's her because the handwriting's way too neat.\nOk. Now that we both have a steaming pile of pancakes, let's take a look at Easel:\nIs that...Conway's Game of Life? Yup, and\nwe're going to get it to run on an easel.\nI bet you can already start to see the different features Easel has. Orpheus can, although it's ended up in a lot of dripping syrup over the letter.\nVariables are created with thepreparekeyword andaskeywords, likeprepare [name] as [value]. We can have strings, numbers, booleans, or arrays.\nGrammar mistake! It's not \"Me and Orpheus\", it's \"Orpheus and I\"! Call the\ngrammar police!\nComments are dictated by the tilde symbol. Me and Orpheus have decided that it looks pretty similar to her eyebrows when she's surprised by something, and comments help you when you're surprised by a piece of code, so we've decided that it's a pretty effective way of annotating our comments.\nStructs are basically maps/objects/dicts/whatever you want to call them with a predefined list of keys. Defining a struct looks something likebrush Cell has { x, y, live }. Creating a struct looks something likeprep Cell(x: 1, y: 1, live: false). Get it? You're prepping a brush. Hehe.\nWe call functions sketches so we define them with the sketch keyword. If a function takes in parameters, you'll need to use theneedskeyword before defining those.\nThese are pretty obvious.\nEasel also has support for the usual operators: AND&&, OR||, and NOT!.\nOrpheus wipes her mouth with her hands and pushes her plate aside. Let's start doing this! We're going to make sure we have the basics first. It's like building Lego, really. The first step is to open dat terminal and start a new project:\nOf course, if you're on a Chromebook or some device of that sort, and you've been following along with our built-in editor, you won't be able to follow this step or the following ones. Just skip down to writing the actual code.\nOpen up thepackage.jsonthat's been created, and add this extra line that'll let us use the modernimportsyntax.\nNext, let's start writing some code! Here's some boilerplate code to go insideeasel.js:\nGo ahead. Type it out! It's good for your health. Well, to be specific, it's\ngood for Orpheus' health. She only has three claws (fingers?) on either hand.\nHer hand-o-pedon (yes, I learned today that it's a thing) says it's good for\nher health. I trust doctors. [shrugs] Anyways, I digress. You can't copy it, unless you're reallydesperate, and that's kind of sad.\nLet's also get some error handling in there. It'll be useful later on for checking if errors are being thrown by our programming language or by JavaScript. Create a new file namedstdlib.jsand throw this in there:\nYou can runnode easel.js test.easelnow and it's rather boring. We could probably spruce it up a bit by writing that programming language. Let's get a-moving!\nNext \u2192\nOrpheus writes a lexer\nHack Club is a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that supports a network of 20k+ technical high schoolers.
