Read this article to learn how multiprocessing works, what system calls really are, how computers manage memory with hardware interrupts, and how Linux loads executables.\nByLexi Mattick&Hack Club\u00b7\n\t\t\t\tJuly, 2023\nI\u2019ve donea lot of things with computers, but I\u2019ve always had a gap in my knowledge: what exactly happens when you run a program on your computer? I thought about this gap \u2014 I had most of the requisite low-level knowledge, but I was struggling to piece everything together. Are programs really executing directly on the CPU, or is something else going on? I\u2019ve used syscalls, but how do theywork? What are they, really? How do multiple programs run at the same time?\nI cracked and started figuring as much out as possible. There aren\u2019t many comprehensive systems resources if you aren\u2019t going to college, so I had to sift through tons of different sources of varying quality and sometimes conflicting information. A couple weeks of research and almost 40 pages of notes later, I think I have a much better idea of how computers work from startup to program execution. I would\u2019ve killed for one solid article explaining what I learned, so I\u2019m writing the article that I wished I had.\nAnd you know what they say\u2026 you only truly understand something if you can explain it to someone else.\nIn a hurry? Feel like you know this stuff already?\nRead chapter 3and I guarantee you will learn something new.

The game is based on the concept of a CPU with 3 registers and anaccumulator(which is like another register):A,B, and*A. The game is played by writing assembly language to solve puzzles. The game is designed to be a fun way to learn assembly language. For example, in the first puzzle, you need to write assembly code that swaps the values of theAandBregisters. One way to do this would be putting theAregister in to theaccumulator, putting the B register into the A register(and in doing so overwriting the previous value), and then putting theaccumulatorinto the B register.

Is 6014 for this or that? Ugh. If you\u2019re a member of multiple HCB organizations, it can be hard telling your cards apart.\nI\u2019ve started writing the organization name on the back of mine:\n\nWe\u2019ve got a more elegant solution for you all, however. You can now customise the logo printed in the top right and we\u2019ve started printing the organization name on the card:\n\n(Apexis a high-altitude balloon-forcused hackathon running on HCB!)\nPlus, we\u2019ve got white cards now. Fancy.\n\nIt's that time of year again! We know you've been hard at work on your nonprofit projects, and we want to celebrate the achievements you've made in 2024. That's why we're excited to announce HCB Wrapped 2024, your year in review!\n\nCheck it out here:hcb.hackclub.com/wrapped\nWe hope you enjoy it. Happy holidays! \ud83c\udf89\nNote:You need to have access to the Google Workspace perk on HCB to use this feature\nHave you ever needed to have multiple emails for your organization (like help@, sponsor@, [your name]@)?\nPreviously, you would have had to create a new account for each address, but you no longer need to.\nOn HCB, you can now create up to 30 aliases per Google Workspace account; all emails to an alias will be sent to its parent account's inbox. No more having to flip through 10 different inboxes!\n\nToday we're launching a new way to stay up-to-date on HCB:our new blog.\nFor as long as I can remember, HCB has been usingHeadwayto announce product updates and changes to users, but over time our needs have shifted. Along with changelog updates, we want to share more content online, like engineering deep-dives, our monthly newsletters, and more.\nWith this change, all of our posts are now open source and available onGitHubas well.\nWe're excited to share more with you in the future. Stay tuned!\nFor a long time, HCB cards appeared as a mysterious, dark, unbranded card in your Apple Wallet.\n\nToday, we're excited to announce that it's getting a new look! Some people might say it's fresh & crisp, just like a juicy apple \ud83c\udf4e. Enjoy!\n\nThanks to Ian and Sam for the design work!\nExciting news for organizations doing work outside the US! HCB now supports sending money to overseas bank accounts via an international wire:\n\nTo send an international wire, you'll need your recipient's bank's SWIFT code and account number as well as some country-specific information. Once you've got that, it's just like sending an ACH transfer to a US bank account on HCB.\nUnfortunately, wires are expensive to send. Our partner bank charges us $25 per wire; therefore, to keep HCB sustainable without passing this fee onto you, each wire sent must be at least $500. We've waived this requirement for organizations that have raised over $50k.\nWhen we need help from you, we want to make sure we're reaching out to the right people.\nBy default, we'll email everyone who is a part of your team on HCB. However, if you have a shared team email or would prefer for us to reach out to a specific email, you can now let us know:\n\nAre you trying to manually link your organization'saccount & routing numberswith a 3rd party service? Sometimes these services will ask for a bank account letter that proves you have access to your account number.\nLuckily for you, sitting right on your documents page is averification letteryou can share. \u2728\u2705\nThis handy one-pager allows organizations on HCB to prove they have access to their account & routing numbers.\n\nLooking for a little bit of extra security? You can now turn on two-factor authentication for your account:\n\nThat'll prompt you for two authentication factors each time you log in, whether it's a hardware security key, a login code sent to your email/phone, or a time-based one time password.\nYou know what they say about 2FA, you may find it mildly annoying but baddies find it infuriating.Ok, no one says that but you get the point.\nAre you a part of multiple organizations on HCB? Simply click on your organization's title to navigate between them! \ud83d\udd25\n"}]}

At STEM Egypt Hack Club, we want our hackers to be creative problem solvers who are also proficient in coding, engineering, and problem-solving.Coding and computer science not only apply to specific problems - it fundamentally teaches how to solve complex problems using step-by-step logic. Coding teaches you how to dissect the issues and find solutions, so knowing it is valuable regardless of the job you end up choosing.

HCB now supports sending money to overseas bank accounts via an international wire:\nTo send an international wire, you'll need your recipient's bank's SWIFT code and account number as well as some country-specific information.

Our partner bank charges us $25 per wire; therefore, to keep HCB sustainable without passing this fee onto you, each wire sent must be at least $500. We've waived this requirement for organizations that have raised over $50k.\nIf you have any feedback on this wires feature, we'd love to hear from you! We're always looking to improve our product, and wires has been a difficult feature to polish.\nWhen we need help from you, we want to make sure we're reaching out to the right people.\nBy default, we'll email everyone who is a part of your team on HCB.

This introduced predetermined permission sets to control users' access in an organization.\nToday,we're introducing spending controls. This allows managers of HCB organizations to impose a finer level of control on how much money a member can spend.\nTo get to a team member's spending controls page, visit the Team page and click on the$icon next to their name.\nA team member's spending controls page gives you consolidated details of how they're using their cards.\nWhen controls are disabled, a member can spend any amount of money with their cards. (Since they're not managers, so still can't transfer via ACH, check, HCB transfer, etc.)\nWith spending controls enabled, new transactions on Fiona's card will be approved/declined based on Fiona's balance.

This $2,500 didn't leave the organization's balance when I created an allowance. Instead, both balances will decrease when she makes a purchase.\nYou should probably also know that these allowances are not time-dependent. They don't expire, and they do not recur (it's not a weekly/monthly limit).\nAs a convenience, you can also choose to enable spending controls and set an initial amount when you invite someone to your organization.\nNeed to get somewhere quickly in HCB?

You can then swing by the new-and-improved Receipt Center at any time to link the receipts from your Receipt Bin to their corresponding transaction.\nText(864) 548-HACKor head tothe settings page\u202cto get started today!\nStarting today, in addition to a CSV or JSON file, you can now export your transaction into a Ledger file for use with theLedger CLI.\nYou may be wondering, what's the backstory behind Ledger? Five years ago, Hack Club HQ used Ledger to keep track of and open source all it's finances:https://github.com/hackclub/ledger. It became too much to maintain. When HQ itself began using HCB, we built Transparency Mode so that we could continue open sourcing our finances. That said, Ledger still is awesome. So now, if you'd like to use the Ledger CLI and are on HCB, you can export your transactions to the.ledgerfile format and have fun exploring your money in the terminal!\nAdditionally, you can also export the transactions of organisations with Transparency Mode enabled, check out HQ's finances:https://hcb.hackclub.com/exports/hq.ledger.\nHey folks! We've got two brand new bits of info to share with you all. First, Hack Club Bank isgrowing\u2014 we just hit \ud83d\udcb8 $10,000,000 \ud83d\udcb8 in total transactions for fiscally sponsored organizations! Go you! (and this doesn't even include Hack Club's money!)\nSecond bit of news: the government has some rules about who can\u2014 and cannot\u2014 call themselves a bank. Now that we've grown a LOT, it's time to change the way we refer to ourselves. As of today,we're shortening our name to HCB.\nTo celebrate, here are 10 acronyms for HCB:\nWe can now be found athcb.hackclub.com,hackclub.com/hcb,hcb@hackclub.com, and so on. Not to fret, though; all of your old links will redirect, and we can still be reached at our old email.\nWe're still the same ol' fiscal sponsor you know and love, just with a few fewer letters.New name, same great taste!\nTired of having transactions declined because you accidentally put in your address instead of ours? Now you can edit your billing address (and update payment information accordingly) wherever you Bank!\n\nSay goodbye to baring the heavy prestige of Fiona Hackworth III, and just be known as Fiona!\nWhile we are required to collect legal names for compliance, most places on Hack Club Bank will now just show your preferred name (if set).\nGo to your settings and set your preferred name today!\n\nHi HCB users! Has it been your lifelong dream to use Google Workspace? \u2601\ufe0f Have you ever wanted to make your emails even more awesome with the flair of a custom domain? Well, now you can - we're relaunching the Google Workspace perk! \ud83c\udf89\nHead on over to your org on Bank, and you'll find that there's now a Google Workspace tab in the sidebar where you can join the waitlist!\n\n\nOnce you've filled out the form, we'll get back to you within the next 48 hours to let you know if you're approved for one of our open slots.\nUnfortunately, we still only have a set limit of slots for access from Google to distribute, but we have systems in place now that will open these up more frequently.\n\ud83d\udcb0 P.S. Orgs with donor funding will be prioritized for open slots.\nNow, when you share links from Hack Club Bank on social media or messaging apps, you'll see a preview image accompanying the link, providing the world with an eye-catching window into your organization\u2019s finances.\n\nAt Hack Club Bank, pushing for financial transparency is one of our primary goals. Social media preview images are a small touch that make your finances more shareable and clickable across the web.\nTry it out today by enablingTransparency Mode, and enjoy the refreshed visual appeal of sharing your finances!\nHCB prides itself on being at the cutting edge of banking technology.

Ignore it every week and now that 1-2 receipts has grown into a much larger number?\nFor those extra receipts, you can now opt-into a receipt report email onyour feature previews page.\nThis just in: Hack Club Bank accounts now have account/routing numbers, which means you can receive payouts from platforms like Shopify and Venmo!\nHere are some cool things you can do with account numbers:\nYou can receive money from any platform that asks for an account/routing number. For security, your account number is deposit-only: you can't withdraw money using it.\nThis is live for everyone right now\u2014 check out the new \"Account/routing number\" page in your sidebar and start receiving money!\n\nFundraising for your nonprofit or hackathon is hard, and takes time away from actually using the donated money. What if the funds could raise themselves?\nTo fix this, I added a monthly subscription option to your organization's donation page\u2014 now when a donor sends a payment, they can opt-in to make their donation monthly. No more manually sending invoices every month.\n\nHere'smy own org'smonthly donation page!\nThis feature is live for everyone right now\u2014 you don't need to opt-in. You can see your recurring donors in your dashboard's Donations tab:\n\nHope this helps you spend less time fundraising, and more time doing whatever it is your nonprofit does.\nAs of today you can test out a new preview feature:SMS notifications when you swipe your card.\nEmails aren't always immediate, and when you're dashing through the checkout line at Costco while stocking up on breakfast for your hackathon 2 minutes could be the difference between remembering to take a photo of your receipt or  throwing it away entirely.\nNow with SMS notifications, you'll get this:\n\nWhen you use your card in-person, you'll get a text with a link to upload your receipt. You can opt-in to the feature preview from yourfeature previewspage.\nIn the future we can add the ability to reply directly to the text with a photo of your receipt.\nYou can name your card to help keep everything organized (eg.

That means any funds you raise between now and then are fee-free! You can check your fee status on your event\u2019s settings page.\nP.S. The first grant hasalready gone out!\n\nRenaming transactions is a great way to organize your finances on Hack Club Bank. It also helps team members and supporters to understand how your organization's money is spent. Upon renaming a transaction, you'll now be provided with a dropdown list of suggestions based on similar, previous transactions in your transaction history!\n\nDonations and invoices now deposit in the time it takes for you to read this sentence.\nWith many financial systems, money can take up to two weeks to move. But now on Hack Club Bank, gone are the days when you had to wait. Behind the scenes, we will seamlessly loan you the incoming funds.\nThe money will be \u2728 instantly \u2728 available for your pizza buying needs!\n\n\u2014 Gary, Ella, and Caleb\nWant to add some pizzazz to your organization's donation page?

You now have access to a simplified, custom form in your \u201cPerks\u201d tab, and once submitted, Bank team will provide you with a custom quote.

We can't wait to see what you ship!\n\nIf you run into any bugs or have any feedback, please let us know at bank@hackclub.com!\n\u2014 Ella, Caleb, and Gary\nHave you ever wanted to change your organization's URL?

It's like magic.\nYou can change your organization's URL by clicking \"Settings\" in the sidebar. Happy hacking!\n\nStarting today, Hack Club Bank will be sending out seasonal newsletters to share about new features, transparent orgs, and other awesome announcements. \ud83c\udf89 Feel free toreach out to meif you didn't receive the summer edition and would like to be added!\n\nThe financial system in the US isa little slow. In personal finance, that's annoying. For a hackathon organizer who needs tobuy50+burritoswhile herding ~~cats~~ attendees & dodging taxis in NYC, slow money transfers is too much.\nAs of todaywe've improved our account transfers beta to instantly add to your balance.\nDonations usually take 3-5 days from a donor swiping their card to finally arriving in your account. Hackathon organizers often zero out their balance while waiting for a donation payment to arrive.\nYou can nowrequest afrontfor paid funds that are still in transit\u2013 if your event is happening within 7 days we'll lend you the funds viaan  instant transfer from us, to you. Once the event is over we'll transfer the funds back out of your account.\nEligible invoices and donations have a button to request a front:\n\nKeep in mind we can only front funds that we can confirm paid (ie. they swiped their card successfully, but the funds haven't arrived yet), and we may take up to 24 hours to get your request. Although we're focusing on hackathons running within 7 days, we know everyone has a different story. If you have a special circumstance, please reach out\u2013 we are happy to talk through it with you.\np.s. Users who enabled theaccount transfer betawill also find their transfers reflect in their budgets immediately, instead of the 3-4 days that it used to take.\nLittle update to the donation form: donors can now contribute to your project using Apple Pay! This feature is now available to all organizations running on Hack Club Bank.\n\nToday we're shipping 3 major improvements to the receipt uploading experience on Hack Club Bank!\nYour receipts pageis now smarter\u2013 just click \"Add a receipt\" or drag & drop a file to instantly attach your receipt. We've also fixed a bug that caused declined & refunded transactions to show up, even though they don't need receipts.The transaction details page has drag & drop, too\u2013 just drop a file anywhere to upload a receipt to that transaction.\nIn a busy checkout line? The \u201cupload a receipt\u201d link we email you has been totally redesigned for mobile, with the ability to take photos of your receipt directly from the page. If you\u2019re uploading from a tablet or laptop, drag-and-drop is also supported.\nFinally, you don\u2019t even have to open Bank\u2013 now you can reply to the \u201cupload a receipt\u201d emails with a photo or PDF of your receipt. This is especially useful if you have limited bandwidth and can't load the site.\nWhat's next\u2013 receipt upload via direct brain connection? We'd love to hear your ideas, both for receipts and other features\u2013 be sure to leave us your feedback in Slack or via the Bank interface!\n\n\u2013 Caleb and Max\nA feature preview is live for users to try out:transfers between HCB accounts.\nPeople who are on multiple teams (ie. running a hackathon and running a club with separate accounts) can manage their money across accounts on Hack Club Bank.\n\nPreviously users would have to invoice themselves to move funds. Besides the 7% fee on those funds, it would take between 5-7 days for funds to show up.Transfers cut the time in half and changes \"fee\" to \"free\".\nYou can enable the betain your account settings. Please send me your feedback!\nA new feature preview is available for users to opt-into. Once enabled, you can reply to the automated \"upload your receipt\" emails with your receipt directly\u2013 no need to click any links.\n\nYou can enable the previewin your account settings.

Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out via email to bank@hackclub.com or in the#bankchannel on Slack if you have any questions or feedback.\nWe've just rolled out a set of changes around card charges to give a better understanding of where a transaction came from.\n\nEach of these charges are onHack Club HQ.\nHey everyone! (\ud83c\udfba\ud83c\udfba noises) I\u2019m announcing my first ever feature contribution to Hack Club Bank. \ud83c\udf89 On your homepage, after logging in, you can now use the section called\"Feedback\"to ... well I think you can guess ... submit any ideas you have for cool new features on Bank! As always, you can still continue to reach out to us on theHack Club Slackor byemail.\n\nFew things are as essential to the banking experience as photo IDs. You always gotta wait for the teller to get a real good look at you, and your ID, before making a transaction. (after all, you wouldn't want your near-identical evil twin stealing your hard-earned money)\nThe Hack Club Bank experience should feel as good or better than a physical IRL bank. Now,you can sign in using just your face (or fingerprint), on supported devices & browsers.\n\nCurrently, this includes modern versions ofGoogle Chrome,Safari, andEdge(as well assomeversionsof Firefox), but you can check for support on your current deviceusing this nifty website.\nHave a Yubikey? Guess what: Bank supports hardware security keys too!\nTo get set up, head on down to the brand newSecurity Keyssection of your Bank settings. You'll be enjoying faster sign-ins in no time!\nI hate passwords. I can neverremember them when I need them, each new account I create means another'unique' password, andpeople are great at leaking them. Wereallydon't want to burden everyone with all that just to access their financial platform, so now it's even easier to login to Hack Club Bank without a password.\nI'm happy to announce thatyou can now get login codes for Hack Club Bank via SMS.The feature can be enabled fromyour settings page.\n\nUsers on iPhone and some Android phones can autofill their SMS login code.\nYou can now get your passwordless login code that much faster\u2013 reducing login on some devices down to under 10 seconds.\nThis post is to explain the background details of our switch to Stripe Issuing. Accounts that need action to make the switch will receive an email.\nEmburse cards have been a feature since one of the earliest versions of Hack Club Bank, allowing any team member to spend money with a debit card without dealing with reimbursements. While that\u2019s been amazing, there have been a few trade-offs with using Emburse:\nThese trade-offs made sense when we first started, but lots of details have changed in the last 2 years. Hack Club Bank has grown by\u2026I started doing the math on this, but the comparison is stupid\u2013our first year on Emburse has less than $1k spent per month, last week Bank users spent $20k through their cards. Emburse has been acquired (by a company that renamed to Emburse) & have shifted their product features.\nRecently Emburse announced they\u2019d be removing the card budgeting feature Bank currently relies on. If we stayed on Emburse the new flow would require organizers to request funds for a purchase, staff (Michael / Chaleb) to approve the purchase amount, then the card could make the transaction. Emburse was super gracious about the change, delaying the budget feature removal long enough for us to switch to another platform.\nThe card alternative we\u2019ve eyed for awhile is Stripe Issuing, but it was in private beta we couldn\u2019t access when we built Hack Club Bank. At the time of writing, we\u2019ve got a private version of Stripe Issuing cards running on Hack Club Bank (only available to admins) to make sure our new system works. I\u2019m happy to say it improves many of the previous issues with cards:\nThis is obviously a big change, and if you have any questions/comments please let us know either by reaching out to bank@hackclub.com or posting in the#bankchannel on Slack.\n4 major improvements to Bank live today:\nAll of this is live for everyone now. More to come! \ud83d\udc40\nThanks to our generous friends over at repl.it, in light of COVID-19,Hack Club Bank users get a free Hacker plan for the next year. Repl.it is an amazing web IDE, where you can get basically any programming language running in your web browser in just a few seconds\u2014regardless of what kind of computer you have. The Hacker plan, normally $84, gives you private projects, unlimited collaborators, & unlimited storage.

If you have any questions, don\u2019t hesitate to reply & ask away!\nLast week, we launched a new feature in Hack Club Bank:Transparency Mode.\nWith Transparency Mode, you can open source your finances instantly from your account settings page. Why would you want to do that? Nonprofit donors deserve to know what their contributions are funding\u2014as a hackathon/nonprofit, you can talk about what you\u2019re spending money on, but transparency in every transaction builds trust for supporters. It\u2019s already live in action!\nThat\u2019s not all. When Hack Club first started, Zach\u2019s hope was to build a different kind of organization: one not only open source with code, but open source with its finances too. Every month, Zach would painstaking put every transactionon GitHub. Unfortunately, as we grew, the tooling took too long & we had to outsource our books to an accounting firm that didn\u2019t know what GitHub was.\nWe\u2019ll be sharing this publicly next week, but Bank users are getting a sneak peek today:Hack Club HQ has been running entirely on Bank for months now, and our finances are public. Dig in, right here:bank.hackclub.com/hq.\nLet\u2019s set a new standard in financial transparency for nonprofits. If you have any questions or feedback on how to improve Transparency Mode, please let us (bank@hackclub.com) know!\nToday, we\u2019re announcing withMajor League Hackingthat Hack Club Bank is the new preferred financial platform for allMLH Member Events.\nWith this announcement,Cal Hacks, the world\u2019s largest college hackathon, is announcing their switch to Hack Club Bank.Spectrais joining them as well.\nClick here to read Linus's full post on this announcement.\nBank can now predict the future! \ud83c\udf00\ud83c\udf89\nIf you want to know when your invoices are coming in, or how much money is going to be automatically withdrawn from your account, Bank will now tell you.\nCheck it out by clicking on either \"Incoming Deposits\" or \"Pending Withdrawals\" on your Bank dashboard.\nIf you've ever wanted to get that old, unpaid invoice off of your invoices page, you now can.\nCheck it out by clicking \"Archive\" when you're viewing an invoice. \ud83d\udea2\ud83c\udf89\nYou can now upload custom  profile pictures on Bank.\nCheck it out by navigating to the Team page and then selecting the settings icon next to your user. \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc4c\nHave you been stuck with a lame URL likehttps://bank.hackclub.com/hack-pennsylvaniaand have wanted to change it to something likehttps://bank.hackclub.com/hackpenn?\nWell, now you can!\nCheck it out in the your Bank's settings. \u2728 \u26a1\ufe0f\nWe've added a document to all projects that you can give to sponsors confirming that you're fiscally sponsored by Hack Club.\nCheck it out in your Documents tab! \u2728\u261d\ufe0f\nHave you ever wanted to attach an image or link to a transaction or invoice? Well, now with the addition ofMarkdown, you can.\nPower up your notes now! \ud83d\ude80\nStarting today, there's no longer a fee for accepting credit cards, bank transfers, or any other payment method.\nYou've invoiced Balsamiq for $500, they paid via credit card, but you only received $485.20. Where'd that $14.80 go? Welcome to the world of payment processing. (HC Bank usesStripe)\nPayment processing fees are annoying. Calculating them ahead of time is frustrating\u00a0and the result is alwayslessmoney\u00a0for your event, club, or project.\nStarting today, Hack Club Bank will make all your payment processing fees disappear.\nThis means that regardless of whether a sponsor is paying via credit card, ACH, or wire, when you send an invoice\u00a0for $500, you'll receive $500.\nAnd we're taking it even further.\nI'm proud to share\u00a0we're also reimbursing all previous payment processing fees, from all time, for everyone.\nDepending on the size of past invoices, you'll receive somewhere between $4.48\u00a0and\u00a0$390.50 (actual numbers) granted to your HC Bank\u00a0account this week.\nIf you want to read more, check out ourblog post with the full story.\nP.S.

Happy hacking!\n\nStarting today, Hack Club Bank will be sending out seasonal newsletters to share about new features, transparent orgs, and other awesome announcements. \ud83c\udf89 Feel free toreach out to meif you didn't receive the summer edition and would like to be added!\n\nThe financial system in the US isa little slow. In personal finance, that's annoying. For a hackathon organizer who needs tobuy50+burritoswhile herding ~~cats~~ attendees & dodging taxis in NYC, slow money transfers is too much.\nAs of todaywe've improved our account transfers beta to instantly add to your balance.\nDonations usually take 3-5 days from a donor swiping their card to finally arriving in your account. Hackathon organizers often zero out their balance while waiting for a donation payment to arrive.\nYou can nowrequest afrontfor paid funds that are still in transit\u2013 if your event is happening within 7 days we'll lend you the funds viaan  instant transfer from us, to you. Once the event is over we'll transfer the funds back out of your account.\nEligible invoices and donations have a button to request a front:\n\nKeep in mind we can only front funds that we can confirm paid (ie. they swiped their card successfully, but the funds haven't arrived yet), and we may take up to 24 hours to get your request. Although we're focusing on hackathons running within 7 days, we know everyone has a different story. If you have a special circumstance, please reach out\u2013 we are happy to talk through it with you.\np.s. Users who enabled theaccount transfer betawill also find their transfers reflect in their budgets immediately, instead of the 3-4 days that it used to take.\nLittle update to the donation form: donors can now contribute to your project using Apple Pay! This feature is now available to all organizations running on Hack Club Bank.\n\nToday we're shipping 3 major improvements to the receipt uploading experience on Hack Club Bank!\nYour receipts pageis now smarter\u2013 just click \"Add a receipt\" or drag & drop a file to instantly attach your receipt. We've also fixed a bug that caused declined & refunded transactions to show up, even though they don't need receipts.The transaction details page has drag & drop, too\u2013 just drop a file anywhere to upload a receipt to that transaction.\nIn a busy checkout line? The \u201cupload a receipt\u201d link we email you has been totally redesigned for mobile, with the ability to take photos of your receipt directly from the page. If you\u2019re uploading from a tablet or laptop, drag-and-drop is also supported.\nFinally, you don\u2019t even have to open Bank\u2013 now you can reply to the \u201cupload a receipt\u201d emails with a photo or PDF of your receipt. This is especially useful if you have limited bandwidth and can't load the site.\nWhat's next\u2013 receipt upload via direct brain connection? We'd love to hear your ideas, both for receipts and other features\u2013 be sure to leave us your feedback in Slack or via the Bank interface!\n\n\u2013 Caleb and Max\nA feature preview is live for users to try out:transfers between HCB accounts.\nPeople who are on multiple teams (ie. running a hackathon and running a club with separate accounts) can manage their money across accounts on Hack Club Bank.\n\nPreviously users would have to invoice themselves to move funds. Besides the 7% fee on those funds, it would take between 5-7 days for funds to show up.Transfers cut the time in half and changes \"fee\" to \"free\".\nYou can enable the betain your account settings. Please send me your feedback!\nA new feature preview is available for users to opt-into. Once enabled, you can reply to the automated \"upload your receipt\" emails with your receipt directly\u2013 no need to click any links.\n\nYou can enable the previewin your account settings. Please send me your feedback!\n\n1Password is providing $100 USD of credit to all organizations on Hack Club Bank. If you're not familiar, 1Password is a password manager that allows you to securely keep and share account logins and credentials with your teammates without the hassle; Hack Club HQ uses 1Password too!\nTo claim the promotion, head to the promotions page on your dashboard and click the \u201cApply\u201d button. Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out via email to bank@hackclub.com or in the#bankchannel on Slack if you have any questions or feedback.\nWe've just rolled out a set of changes around card charges to give a better understanding of where a transaction came from.\n\nEach of these charges are onHack Club HQ.\nHey everyone! (\ud83c\udfba\ud83c\udfba noises) I\u2019m announcing my first ever feature contribution to Hack Club Bank. \ud83c\udf89 On your homepage, after logging in, you can now use the section called\"Feedback\"to ... well I think you can guess ... submit any ideas you have for cool new features on Bank! As always, you can still continue to reach out to us on theHack Club Slackor byemail.\n\nFew things are as essential to the banking experience as photo IDs. You always gotta wait for the teller to get a real good look at you, and your ID, before making a transaction. (after all, you wouldn't want your near-identical evil twin stealing your hard-earned money)\nThe Hack Club Bank experience should feel as good or better than a physical IRL bank. Now,you can sign in using just your face (or fingerprint), on supported devices & browsers.\n\nCurrently, this includes modern versions ofGoogle Chrome,Safari, andEdge(as well assomeversionsof Firefox), but you can check for support on your current deviceusing this nifty website.\nHave a Yubikey? Guess what: Bank supports hardware security keys too!\nTo get set up, head on down to the brand newSecurity Keyssection of your Bank settings. You'll be enjoying faster sign-ins in no time!\nI hate passwords. I can neverremember them when I need them, each new account I create means another'unique' password, andpeople are great at leaking them. Wereallydon't want to burden everyone with all that just to access their financial platform, so now it's even easier to login to Hack Club Bank without a password.\nI'm happy to announce thatyou can now get login codes for Hack Club Bank via SMS.The feature can be enabled fromyour settings page.\n\nUsers on iPhone and some Android phones can autofill their SMS login code.\nYou can now get your passwordless login code that much faster\u2013 reducing login on some devices down to under 10 seconds.\nThis post is to explain the background details of our switch to Stripe Issuing. Accounts that need action to make the switch will receive an email.\nEmburse cards have been a feature since one of the earliest versions of Hack Club Bank, allowing any team member to spend money with a debit card without dealing with reimbursements. While that\u2019s been amazing, there have been a few trade-offs with using Emburse:\nThese trade-offs made sense when we first started, but lots of details have changed in the last 2 years. Hack Club Bank has grown by\u2026I started doing the math on this, but the comparison is stupid\u2013our first year on Emburse has less than $1k spent per month, last week Bank users spent $20k through their cards. Emburse has been acquired (by a company that renamed to Emburse) & have shifted their product features.\nRecently Emburse announced they\u2019d be removing the card budgeting feature Bank currently relies on. If we stayed on Emburse the new flow would require organizers to request funds for a purchase, staff (Michael / Chaleb) to approve the purchase amount, then the card could make the transaction. Emburse was super gracious about the change, delaying the budget feature removal long enough for us to switch to another platform.\nThe card alternative we\u2019ve eyed for awhile is Stripe Issuing, but it was in private beta we couldn\u2019t access when we built Hack Club Bank. At the time of writing, we\u2019ve got a private version of Stripe Issuing cards running on Hack Club Bank (only available to admins) to make sure our new system works. I\u2019m happy to say it improves many of the previous issues with cards:\nThis is obviously a big change, and if you have any questions/comments please let us know either by reaching out to bank@hackclub.com or posting in the#bankchannel on Slack.\n4 major improvements to Bank live today:\nAll of this is live for everyone now. More to come! \ud83d\udc40\nThanks to our generous friends over at repl.it, in light of COVID-19,Hack Club Bank users get a free Hacker plan for the next year. Repl.it is an amazing web IDE, where you can get basically any programming language running in your web browser in just a few seconds\u2014regardless of what kind of computer you have. The Hacker plan, normally $84, gives you private projects, unlimited collaborators, & unlimited storage. They\u2019ve generously sponsored many events that have run on Hack Club Bank, and we\u2019re so thankful for their continued support.\nTo claim your subscription, visit the promo page & click \"Apply\". It\u2019s limited to the first 500 people who claim it, so don\u2019t wait.\nHope you\u2019re safe & well. If you have any questions, don\u2019t hesitate to reply & ask away!\nLast week, we launched a new feature in Hack Club Bank:Transparency Mode.\nWith Transparency Mode, you can open source your finances instantly from your account settings page. Why would you want to do that? Nonprofit donors deserve to know what their contributions are funding\u2014as a hackathon/nonprofit, you can talk about what you\u2019re spending money on, but transparency in every transaction builds trust for supporters. It\u2019s already live in action!\nThat\u2019s not all. When Hack Club first started, Zach\u2019s hope was to build a different kind of organization: one not only open source with code, but open source with its finances too. Every month, Zach would painstaking put every transactionon GitHub. Unfortunately, as we grew, the tooling took too long & we had to outsource our books to an accounting firm that didn\u2019t know what GitHub was.\nWe\u2019ll be sharing this publicly next week, but Bank users are getting a sneak peek today:Hack Club HQ has been running entirely on Bank for months now, and our finances are public. Dig in, right here:bank.hackclub.com/hq.\nLet\u2019s set a new standard in financial transparency for nonprofits. If you have any questions or feedback on how to improve Transparency Mode, please let us (bank@hackclub.com) know!\nToday, we\u2019re announcing withMajor League Hackingthat Hack Club Bank is the new preferred financial platform for allMLH Member Events.\nWith this announcement,Cal Hacks, the world\u2019s largest college hackathon, is announcing their switch to Hack Club Bank.Spectrais joining them as well.\nClick here to read Linus's full post on this announcement.\nBank can now predict the future! \ud83c\udf00\ud83c\udf89\nIf you want to know when your invoices are coming in, or how much money is going to be automatically withdrawn from your account, Bank will now tell you.\nCheck it out by clicking on either \"Incoming Deposits\" or \"Pending Withdrawals\" on your Bank dashboard.\nIf you've ever wanted to get that old, unpaid invoice off of your invoices page, you now can.\nCheck it out by clicking \"Archive\" when you're viewing an invoice. \ud83d\udea2\ud83c\udf89\nYou can now upload custom  profile pictures on Bank.\nCheck it out by navigating to the Team page and then selecting the settings icon next to your user. \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc4c\nHave you been stuck with a lame URL likehttps://bank.hackclub.com/hack-pennsylvaniaand have wanted to change it to something likehttps://bank.hackclub.com/hackpenn?\nWell, now you can!\nCheck it out in the your Bank's settings. \u2728 \u26a1\ufe0f\nWe've added a document to all projects that you can give to sponsors confirming that you're fiscally sponsored by Hack Club.\nCheck it out in your Documents tab! \u2728\u261d\ufe0f\nHave you ever wanted to attach an image or link to a transaction or invoice? Well, now with the addition ofMarkdown, you can.\nPower up your notes now! \ud83d\ude80\nStarting today, there's no longer a fee for accepting credit cards, bank transfers, or any other payment method.\nYou've invoiced Balsamiq for $500, they paid via credit card, but you only received $485.20. Where'd that $14.80 go? Welcome to the world of payment processing. (HC Bank usesStripe)\nPayment processing fees are annoying. Calculating them ahead of time is frustrating\u00a0and the result is alwayslessmoney\u00a0for your event, club, or project.\nStarting today, Hack Club Bank will make all your payment processing fees disappear.\nThis means that regardless of whether a sponsor is paying via credit card, ACH, or wire, when you send an invoice\u00a0for $500, you'll receive $500.\nAnd we're taking it even further.\nI'm proud to share\u00a0we're also reimbursing all previous payment processing fees, from all time, for everyone.\nDepending on the size of past invoices, you'll receive somewhere between $4.48\u00a0and\u00a0$390.50 (actual numbers) granted to your HC Bank\u00a0account this week.\nIf you want to read more, check out ourblog post with the full story.\nP.S.

For now: Logic is step-by-step cognition, like solving math problems. Intuition is all-at-oncerecognition, like seeing if a picture is of a cat. \"Intuition and Logic\" roughly map onto \"System 1 and 2\" from cognitive science.[1][2](\ud83d\udc48 hover over these footnotes! they expand!)\nAs you can tell by the \"scare\" \"quotes\" on\"versus\", these divisions ain't really so divided after all...\nHere's how these conflicts repeat over this 3-part series:\nSkipping over alotof detail, the history of AI is a tale ofLogic vs Intuition:\nBefore 2000: AI was all logic, no intuition.\nThis was why, in 1997, AI could beat the world champion at chess... yet no AIs could reliably recognize cats in pictures.[3]\n(Safety concern: Without intuition, AI can't understand common sense or humane values. Thus, AI might achieve goals in logically-correct but undesirable ways.)\nAfter 2000: AI could do \"intuition\", but had very poor logic.\nThis is why generative AIs (as of current writing, May 2024) can dream up whole landscapes in any artist's style...:yet gets confused drawing more than 3 objects.(\ud83d\udc48 click this text! it also expands!)\n(Safety concern: Without logic, we can't verify what's happening in an AI's \"intuition\". That intuition could be biased, subtly-but-dangerously wrong, or fail bizarrely in new scenarios.)\nCurrent Day: Westilldon't know how to unify logic & intuition in AI.\nBut if/when we do,thatwould give us the biggest risks & rewards of AI: something that can logically out-plan us,andlearn general intuition. That'd be an \"AI Einstein\"... or an \"AI Oppenheimer\".\nSummed in a picture:\n\nSo that's \"Logic vs Intuition\". As for the other core conflict, \"Problems in the AI vs The Humans\", that's one of the big controversies in the field of AI Safety: are our main risks from advanced AIitself, or fromhumansmisusing advanced AI?\n(Why not both?)\nTheproblem of AI Safety is this:[4]\nThe Value Alignment Problem:\u201cHow can we make AI robustly serve humane values?\u201d\nNOTE: I wrotehumane, with an \"e\", not just \"human\". Ahumanmay or may not behumane. I'm going to harp on this becausebothadvocates & critics of AI Safety keep mixing up the two.[5][6]\nWe can break this problem down by \"Problems in Humans vs AI\":\nHumane Values:\u201cWhatarehumane values, anyway?\u201d(a problem for philosophy & ethics)\nTheTechnicalAlignment Problem:\u201cHow can we make AI robustly serveany intended goalat all?\u201d(a problem for computer scientists - surprisingly, still unsolved!)\nThetechnicalalignment problem, in turn, can be broken down by \"Logic vs Intuition\":\nProblems with AI Logic:[7](\"game theory\" problems)\nProblems with AI Intuition:[8](\"deep learning\" problems)\n(Again, what \"logic\" and \"intuition\" are will be more precisely explained later!)\nSummed in a picture:\n\nAs intuition for how hard these problems are, note that we haven't even solved themfor us humans\u2014 People follow the letter of the law, not the spirit. People's intuition can be biased, and fail in new circumstances. And none of us are 100% the humane humans we wished we were.\nSo, if I may be a bit sappy, maybe understanding AI will help us understand ourselves. And just maybe, we can solve thehumanalignment problem: How do we gethumansto robustly serve humane values?\nFinally, we can understand some (possible) ways to solve the problems in logic, intuition, AIs,andhumans! These include:\n\u2014 and more! Experts disagree on which proposals will work, if any... but it's a good start.\n(Unfortunately, I can't give a layperson-friendly summary in this Intro, because these solutions won't make senseuntilyou understand the problems, which is what Part 1 & 2 are for. That said, if you want spoilers,:click here to see what Part 3 will cover!)\nHey, d'ya ever get this feeling?\nTo avoid that forthisguide, I've included someOPTIONALinteractive flashcards! They use \"Spaced Repetition\", an easy-ish, evidence-backed way to \"make long-term memory a choice\". (:click here to learn more about Spaced Repetition!)\nHere:try the below flashcards, to retain what you just learnt!\n(There's an optional sign-up at the end,ifyou want to save these cards for long-term study. Note:I do not own or control this app, it's third-party. If you'd rather use the open source flashcard appAnki,here'sa downloadable Anki deck!)\n(Also, you don't need to memorize the answersexactly, just the gist. You be the judge if you got it \"close enough\".)\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t what you don\u2019t know that gets you into trouble.\nIt\u2019s what you know for sure that just ain\u2019t so.\u201d\n~ often attributed to Mark Twain, but it just ain't so[9]\nFor better and worse, you've already heard too much about AI. So before we connectnewpuzzle pieces in your mind, we gotta take out theoldpieces that just ain't so.\nThus, if you'll indulge me in a \"Top 5\" listicle...\n\nAI Safety / AI Risk used to be less mainstream, but now in 2024, the US & UK governments now have AI Safety-specific departments![10]This resulted from many ofthetop AI researchers raising alarm bells about it. These folks include:\n(To be clear: therearealso top AI researchersagainstfears of AI Risk, such Yann LeCun,[16]co-winner of the 2018 Turing Prize, and chief AI researcher atFacebookMeta. Another notable name is Melanie Mitchell[17], a researcher in AI & complexity science.)\nI'm aware \"look at these experts\" is an appeal to authority, but this isonlyto counter the idea of, \"eh, only sci-fi weebs fear AI Risk\". But in the end, appeal to authority/weebs isn't enough; you have toactually understand the dang thing. (Which youaredoing, by reading this! So thank you.)\nBut speaking of sci-fi weebs...\nSci-fi authors write sentient AIs because they're writingstories, not technical papers. The philosophical debate on artificial consciousness is fascinating,and irrelevant to AI Safety.Analogy: a nuclear bomb isn't conscious, but it can still be unsafe, no?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the real problems in AI Safety are \"boring\": an AI learns the wrong things from its biased training data, it breaks in slightly-new scenarios, it logically accomplishes goals in undesired ways, etc.\nBut, \"boring\" doesn't meannot important. The technical details of how to design a safe elevator/airplane/bridge are boring to most laypeople...and alsoa matter of life-and-death.\n(Catastrophic AI Risk doesn't even require \"super-human general intelligence\"! For example, an AI that's \"only\" good at designing viruses could help a bio-terrorist organization (like Aum Shinrikyo[18]) kill millions of people.)\nBut speaking of killing people...\n\nWhile most AI researchersdobelieve advanced AI poses a 5+% risk of \"literally everybody dies\"[19], it'sveryhard to convince folks (especially policymakers) of stuff that's never happened before.\nSo instead, I'd like to highlight the ways that advanced AI \u2013 (especially when it's available to anyone with a high-end computer) \u2013 could lead to catastrophes, \"merely\" by scaling upalready-existingbad stuff.\nFor example:\nThe above examples are all \"humansmisuseAI to cause havoc\", but remember advanced AI could do the aboveby itself, due to \"boring\" reasons: it's accomplishing a goal in a logical-but-undesirable way, its goals glitch out but its skills remain intact, etc.\n(Bonus,:Some concrete, plausible ways a rogue AI could \"escape containment\", or affect the physical world.)\nPoint is: even if one doesn't think AI is aliteral 100% human extinctionrisk... I'd say \"homebrew bio-terrorism\" & \"1984 with robots\" are still worth taking seriously.\nOn the flipside...\n\nAI Risk folks aren't Luddites. In fact, they warn about AI's downsidesprecisely becausethey care about AI's upsides.[30]As humorist Gil Stern once said:[31]\n\u201cBoth the optimist and the pessimist contribute to society: the optimist invents the airplane, and the pessimist invents the parachute.\u201d\nSo: even as this series goes into detail on how AIis alreadygoing wrong, it's worth remembering the few ways AIis alreadygoing right:\nToo often, we take technology \u2014 even life-saving technology \u2014 for granted. So, let me zoom out for context. Here's the last 2000+ years of child mortality, the percentage of kids who die before puberty:\n(fromDattani, Spooner, Ritchie and Roser (2023))\nForthousandsof years, in nations both rich and poor, a fullhalfof kids just died. This was a constant. Then, starting in the 1800s \u2014 thanks to science/tech like germ theory, sanitation, medicine, clean water, vaccines, etc \u2014 child mortality fell off like a cliff. We still have far more to go \u2014 I refuse to accept[33]a worldwide 4.3% (1 in 23) child death rate \u2014 but let's just appreciate how humanityso swiftly cut downaneons-oldscourge.\nHow did we achieve this? Policy's a big part of the story, but policy is \"the art of the possible\"[34], and the above wouldn't have been possible withoutgoodscience & tech. If safe, humane AI can help us progress further by even just a few percent \u2014 towards slaying the remaining dragons of cancer, Alzheimer's, HIV/AIDS, etc \u2014 that'd be tens of millions more of our loved ones, who get to beat the Reaper for another day.\nF#@\u2606 going to Mars,that'swhy advanced AI matters.\n. . .\nWait,really?Toys like ChatGPT and DALL-E arelife-and-deathstakes? That leads us to the final misconception I'd like to address:\nOh come on,one might reasonably retort,AI can't consistently draw more than 3 objects. How's it going to take over the world? Heck, how's it even going to take my job?\nI present to you, arelevant xkcd:\n\nThis is how I feel about \"don't worry about AI, it can't even do [X]\".\nIs our postmodern memory-spanthatbad?Onedecade ago, justone, the world's state-of-the-art AIs couldn't reliablyrecognize pictures of cats.Now, notonlycan AI do that at human-performance level, AIs can pump out:a picture of a cat-ninja slicing a watermelon in the style of Vincent Van Goghinunder a minute.\nIscurrentAI a huge threat to our jobs, or safety? No. (Well, besides the aforementioned deepfake scams.)\nBut: if AI keeps improving at a similar rate as it has for the last decade... it seems plausible to me we could get \"Einstein/Oppenheimer-level\" AI in 30 years.[35]That's well within many folks' lifetimes!\nAs \"they\" say:[36]\nThe best time to plant a tree was 30 years ago. The second best time is today.\nLet's plant that tree today!\n(To review the flashcards, click theTable of Contents icon in the right sidebar, then click the \"\ud83e\udd14 Review\" links.

When I have a tangent that doesn't fit the main flow, I'll shove it into an \"expandable\" section like this one!

But judging by its other attempts, it's clearly luck.)\nWhy does this demonstrate a lack of \"logic\" in AI? A core part of \"symbolic logic\" is the ability to do \"compositionality\", a fancy way of saying it can reliably combine old things into new things, like \"green\" + \"cylinder\" = \"green cylinder\". As shown above, generative AIs (as of May 2024) areveryunreliable at combining stuff, when there's more than 3 objects.\n~ ~ ~\nAnyway, that's the end of this Nutshell!

But I'm putting this here now, for:\na) The layperson audience, to reassure y'all that, yes, therearemany promising proposed solutions.\nb) The expert audience, to reassure y'all that, yes, I probably have your niche lil' thing in here.\nAnyway, the TOP 10 TYPES-OF-SOLUTIONS to AI Safety: (with the fancy jargon in parentheses)\n\u201cUse it, or lose it.\u201d\nThat's the core principle behind both muscles and brains. (It rhymes, so it must be true!) As decades of educational research robustly show (Dunlosky et al., 2013 [pdf]), if you want to retain something long-term, it's not enough to re-read or highlight stuff: you have to actuallytest yourself.\nThat's why flashcards work so well! But, two problems: 1) It's overwhelming when you havehundredsof cards you want to remember. And 2) It's inefficient to review cards youalreadyknow well.\nSpaced Repetitionsolves both these problems! To see how, let's see what happens if you learn a fact, thendon'treview it. Your memory of it decays over time, until you cross a threshold where you've likely forgotten it:\n\nBut, if you review a factjust beforeyou forget it, you can get your memory-strength back up...and more importantly, your memory of that fact will decayslower!\n\nSo, with Spaced Repetition, we review right before you're predicted to forget a card, over and over. As you can see, the reviews get more and more spread out:\n\nThis is what makes Spaced Repetition so efficient!Every time you successfully review a card, the interval to your next reviewmultiplies.For example, let's say our multiplier is 2x. So you review a card on Day 1, then Day 2, then Day4, Day 8, 16, 32, 64... until, with justfifteen reviews, you can remember a card for 215= 32,768 days =ninety years. (In theory. In practice it's less, but still super efficient!)\nAnd that's just foronecard. Thanks to the exponentially-growing gaps, you can add 10 new cards a day (the recommended amount), to long-term retain3650 cardsa year... withless than 20 minutes of reviewa day. (For context, 3000+ cards is enough to master basic vocabulary for a new language! In one year, with just 20 minutes a day!)\nSpaced Repetition is one ofthemost evidence-backed ways to learn (Kang 2016 [pdf]). But outside of language-learning communities & med school, it isn't very well-known...yet.\nSo: how canyouget started with Spaced Repetition?\nFor more info on spaced repetition, check out these videos byAli Abdaal (26 min)andThomas Frank (8 min).\nAndthat'show you can make long-term memory a choice!\nHappy learning! \ud83d\udc4d\nWays an AI could \"escape containment\":\nWays an AI could affect the physical world:\nTwo months ago [March 2024], avolunteer, off-the-clockdeveloper found a malicious backdoor in a major piece of code... which wasthree yearsin the making,mere weeks awayfrom going live, and would've attacked the vast majority of internet servers... and this volunteer only caught itby accident, when he noticed that his code was runninghalf a second too slow.\nThis was the XZ Utils Backdoor.

Sign upherebefore June 07!\nHigh schooler?Get stickers!\nOrpheus gets mail\nEasel, the programming language\nVariables\nComments\nStructs\nFunctions\nLoops and if-else statements\nSetup\nIt's a normal Saturday for Orpheus the dinosaur. Or rather, not normal. This is the first Saturday in a while where she can lie in bed alone, look out the window, and daydream about whatever she wants to. No tea parties to go to, no meetings, no nothing. She can just lie in bed and think about pancakes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\nWhat a perfect day. You know what would be even more perfect? Actual pancakes. Blueberry pancakes, chocolate pancakes, banana pancakes. That means she has got to get out of bed and check if she has those ingredients. She rolls over and out of bed and into the kitchen.\nWhen she gets to the kitchen, there's a knock on the door. Now, Orpheus' house is laid out in such a way that the front door leads to the kitchen. Or rather, the kitchen leads to the front door. (The magic of perspective.)\nI know when you read this you will be most suspicious of me, the narrator. Trust me. I am not the mysterious person that you will learn about later. I just happen to be omnipresent.\nPerfect timing!, she thinks.Almost like someone knows what I'm doing at the current moment.\nThe doorbell rings insistently again. Orpheusrunsstomps her way over to the door and opens it, but no one's there! She looks around. Nobody's around. It's kind of a dull and gray day outside, honestly, although the rain is making nice pitter-patter sounds on the porch screens.\nShe looks down. There's a box at her feet. Ooh. Could it be fan mail? She bends down to pick it up.\nYes, Orpheus gets fan mail. If you want to send her some after reading this\nyou can send them to 15 Falls Road, Shelburne VT 05482.\nShe rips apart the box with her claws, and three things fall out: a keyboard sort of thing with a very small screen (a computer??), a grid-like boxy sort of contraption (something like this.Orpheus and I couldn't come up with a better description when we were arguing over the sequence of events), and a nice, fancy piece of paper that Orpheus can't help but put her nose up to. It smells good. Like paper, you know?\nOrpheus reads the letter.\nI hope this letter finds you well. Maybe on a cozy rainy Saturday morning. In the confines of this package (there is only so much you can fit inside a decent package when you are trying to adhere to USPS shipping guidelines while also trying to be budget-friendly), there are two things: a computer unlike anything you normally use, for interfacing with the second thing, an easel.\nThe easel is a blank, sad thing right now. You need to paint it. Now, you can't paint it with any normal paint and brush. What, do you think this is, that one boy with that one purple crayon that he can just make random shite come to life with by scribbling?\nNo,you must talk to it.\nI know you've wanted to be an artist. And now you have a chance to be a special one. An artist who can also perform magic! Figure out how to talk to the easel with the computer I have provided, and you can do both. Hint: you need to write a programming language. The one I have included is called Easel, and is a good starting point.\nThere is much you'll learn along the way. You might even find that there's a surprise or two, too. (See what I did there? Punny. Yes, I am quite a humorous person. It is something I pride myself on. Quite masterful at pranks, too.)\nYou'll probably go back to cooking pancakes or something. There are many reasons to do this, though, and here I'll rank them in alphabetical order:\nFrom the narrator: programming language idea? Star Wars-based programming language? Very based. (I heard that's the hip word nowadays.)\nSigned,\nyour mysterious sender\nP.S. I know that you would like to know who I am because who doesn't? So let's strike a compromise. Once you figure out how to paint this easel, you'll be able to run this:\nAnd figure out who I am.\nOrpheus is slightly taken aback. Erm, crepey. Sorry, creepy. Her stomach rumbles. Sorry. Just a little bit hungry. How does this mysterious sender know everything that is happening, in real time? Guess the only way to find out is to write that programming language.\nHm. Orpheus could go cook pancakes, or she could figure out this easel and who in the hecktie-neckties this mysterious person is. Or she could do both.\nShe's never written a programming language before, but then, I presume you haven't, either. This is an invitation for you to join Orpheus' pancake party.\nGo cook your pancakes! We'll be back in half an hour.\nThese are the recipes we used. I found them in one of Orpheus' many drawers, but I don't think it's her because the handwriting's way too neat.\nOk. Now that we both have a steaming pile of pancakes, let's take a look at Easel:\nIs that...Conway's Game of Life? Yup, and\nwe're going to get it to run on an easel.\nI bet you can already start to see the different features Easel has. Orpheus can, although it's ended up in a lot of dripping syrup over the letter.\nVariables are created with thepreparekeyword andaskeywords, likeprepare [name] as [value]. We can have strings, numbers, booleans, or arrays.\nGrammar mistake! It's not \"Me and Orpheus\", it's \"Orpheus and I\"! Call the\ngrammar police!\nComments are dictated by the tilde symbol. Me and Orpheus have decided that it looks pretty similar to her eyebrows when she's surprised by something, and comments help you when you're surprised by a piece of code, so we've decided that it's a pretty effective way of annotating our comments.\nStructs are basically maps/objects/dicts/whatever you want to call them with a predefined list of keys. Defining a struct looks something likebrush Cell has { x, y, live }. Creating a struct looks something likeprep Cell(x: 1, y: 1, live: false). Get it? You're prepping a brush. Hehe.\nWe call functions sketches so we define them with the sketch keyword. If a function takes in parameters, you'll need to use theneedskeyword before defining those.\nThese are pretty obvious.\nEasel also has support for the usual operators: AND&&, OR||, and NOT!.\nOrpheus wipes her mouth with her hands and pushes her plate aside. Let's start doing this! We're going to make sure we have the basics first. It's like building Lego, really. The first step is to open dat terminal and start a new project:\nOf course, if you're on a Chromebook or some device of that sort, and you've been following along with our built-in editor, you won't be able to follow this step or the following ones. Just skip down to writing the actual code.\nOpen up thepackage.jsonthat's been created, and add this extra line that'll let us use the modernimportsyntax.\nNext, let's start writing some code! Here's some boilerplate code to go insideeasel.js:\nGo ahead. Type it out! It's good for your health. Well, to be specific, it's\ngood for Orpheus' health. She only has three claws (fingers?) on either hand.\nHer hand-o-pedon (yes, I learned today that it's a thing) says it's good for\nher health. I trust doctors. [shrugs] Anyways, I digress. You can't copy it, unless you're reallydesperate, and that's kind of sad.\nLet's also get some error handling in there. It'll be useful later on for checking if errors are being thrown by our programming language or by JavaScript. Create a new file namedstdlib.jsand throw this in there:\nYou can runnode easel.js test.easelnow and it's rather boring. We could probably spruce it up a bit by writing that programming language. Let's get a-moving!\nNext \u2192\nOrpheus writes a lexer\nHack Club is a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that supports a network of 20k+ technical high schoolers.

Countless students here within Texas have taken the\n      support of club leaders in their schools and we hear of the enormous\n      success of their events. For example, theirOuter nethack-a-thon this\n      summer got youth around from the entire world to work on projects together\n      in Vermont, Vt, USA. It is from HackerClub that many students of UT Austin\n      attribute their coding journey to, something that we love to hear about at\n      our universities.\nSparking the fuse of excitement in students is the state of Texas's\n        education goal, and we find that HackerClub best aligns with these\n        goals. It is in our best interests to carry forward this new generation\n        of studious young leaders in the Lonestar state, which is why we must\n        support this prestigious organization. HackerClub supports students to\n        open their own \"HackerClubs\" in their own highscools, which allows their\n        peers to benefit from added knowledge after school. It is this program\n        that we found interesting within HackerClub, and we would like to widen\n        the scope of this to all high school students in the Texas state.\nadd more description here - george\nFrom the wide reach of their \"Slack\" online chats, we have found it\n      important to increase the reach of this organization. Hence, we will be\n      partnering with HackerClub to provide these clubs to all schools in the\n      state of Texas. These clubs will be led by a qualified teacher with a\n      minimum knowledge requirement of programming. The various tasks that these\n      clubs will do will be great and spread knowledge to all students and bring\n      the state of Texas to the forefront of computing, rivaling big tech hubs\n      like the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and New York. Partnering with\n      the University of Texas & Texas Education Agency means that HackerClub\n      will be able to utilize our vast net of resources to spread the joy of\n      computer programming to the future leaders of America. We hope that this\n      new partnership will bring about a great step forward and positive changes\n      to the state of Texas's student performance.\nThis great partnership will be named the TEACH initiative, and we hope to\n      include more partners in the future as well."}]}

In 2017, I joined as a founding board member, and I\u2019ve seen firsthand the leadership team act with integrity and transparency since Day 1. Founder Zach Latta and COO Christina Asquith are efficient, responsible and disciplined stewards of every dollar, and I've proudly grown my donations over the years.\nWith major support, I am confident Hack Club will change the world. I have met dozens of teenagers involved in Hack Club, and seen how it already is having an enormous impact in their lives.\nHack Club is inspiring a generation of teenagers to become highly-technical builders, innovators and problem-solvers \u2014 and it is making the path to success accessible to all young people regardless of background. I believe in Hack Club, and I'm looking forward to staying involved for the long term. I also personally intend to continue and grow my financial support of their mission.\""}]}

I thought about this gap \u2014 I had most of the requisite low-level knowledge, but I was struggling to piece everything together. Are programs really executing directly on the CPU, or is something else going on? I\u2019ve used syscalls, but how do theywork? What are they, really? How do multiple programs run at the same time?\nI cracked and started figuring as much out as possible. There aren\u2019t many comprehensive systems resources if you aren\u2019t going to college, so I had to sift through tons of different sources of varying quality and sometimes conflicting information. A couple weeks of research and almost 40 pages of notes later, I think I have a much better idea of how computers work from startup to program execution. I would\u2019ve killed for one solid article explaining what I learned, so I\u2019m writing the article that I wished I had.\nAnd you know what they say\u2026 you only truly understand something if you can explain it to someone else.\nIn a hurry?

This introduced predetermined permission sets to control users' access in an organization.\nToday,we're introducing spending controls. This allows managers of HCB organizations to impose a finer level of control on how much money a member can spend.\nTo get to a team member's spending controls page, visit the Team page and click on the$icon next to their name.\nA team member's spending controls page gives you consolidated details of how they're using their cards.\nWhen controls are disabled, a member can spend any amount of money with their cards.

This $2,500 didn't leave the organization's balance when I created an allowance. Instead, both balances will decrease when she makes a purchase.\nYou should probably also know that these allowances are not time-dependent. They don't expire, and they do not recur (it's not a weekly/monthly limit).\nAs a convenience, you can also choose to enable spending controls and set an initial amount when you invite someone to your organization.\nNeed to get somewhere quickly in HCB?

When HQ itself began using HCB, we built Transparency Mode so that we could continue open sourcing our finances. That said, Ledger still is awesome. So now, if you'd like to use the Ledger CLI and are on HCB, you can export your transactions to the.ledgerfile format and have fun exploring your money in the terminal!\nAdditionally, you can also export the transactions of organisations with Transparency Mode enabled, check out HQ's finances:https://hcb.hackclub.com/exports/hq.ledger.\nHey folks!

Once the event is over we'll transfer the funds back out of your account.\nEligible invoices and donations have a button to request a front:\n\nKeep in mind we can only front funds that we can confirm paid (ie. they swiped their card successfully, but the funds haven't arrived yet), and we may take up to 24 hours to get your request. Although we're focusing on hackathons running within 7 days, we know everyone has a different story. If you have a special circumstance, please reach out\u2013 we are happy to talk through it with you.\np.s. Users who enabled theaccount transfer betawill also find their transfers reflect in their budgets immediately, instead of the 3-4 days that it used to take.\nLittle update to the donation form: donors can now contribute to your project using Apple Pay! This feature is now available to all organizations running on Hack Club Bank.\n\nToday we're shipping 3 major improvements to the receipt uploading experience on Hack Club Bank!\nYour receipts pageis now smarter\u2013 just click \"Add a receipt\" or drag & drop a file to instantly attach your receipt. We've also fixed a bug that caused declined & refunded transactions to show up, even though they don't need receipts.The transaction details page has drag & drop, too\u2013 just drop a file anywhere to upload a receipt to that transaction.\nIn a busy checkout line? The \u201cupload a receipt\u201d link we email you has been totally redesigned for mobile, with the ability to take photos of your receipt directly from the page. If you\u2019re uploading from a tablet or laptop, drag-and-drop is also supported.\nFinally, you don\u2019t even have to open Bank\u2013 now you can reply to the \u201cupload a receipt\u201d emails with a photo or PDF of your receipt. This is especially useful if you have limited bandwidth and can't load the site.\nWhat's next\u2013 receipt upload via direct brain connection? We'd love to hear your ideas, both for receipts and other features\u2013 be sure to leave us your feedback in Slack or via the Bank interface!\n\n\u2013 Caleb and Max\nA feature preview is live for users to try out:transfers between HCB accounts.\nPeople who are on multiple teams (ie. running a hackathon and running a club with separate accounts) can manage their money across accounts on Hack Club Bank.\n\nPreviously users would have to invoice themselves to move funds. Besides the 7% fee on those funds, it would take between 5-7 days for funds to show up.Transfers cut the time in half and changes \"fee\" to \"free\".\nYou can enable the betain your account settings. Please send me your feedback!\nA new feature preview is available for users to opt-into. Once enabled, you can reply to the automated \"upload your receipt\" emails with your receipt directly\u2013 no need to click any links.\n\nYou can enable the previewin your account settings. Please send me your feedback!\n\n1Password is providing $100 USD of credit to all organizations on Hack Club Bank. If you're not familiar, 1Password is a password manager that allows you to securely keep and share account logins and credentials with your teammates without the hassle; Hack Club HQ uses 1Password too!\nTo claim the promotion, head to the promotions page on your dashboard and click the \u201cApply\u201d button. Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out via email to bank@hackclub.com or in the#bankchannel on Slack if you have any questions or feedback.\nWe've just rolled out a set of changes around card charges to give a better understanding of where a transaction came from.\n\nEach of these charges are onHack Club HQ.\nHey everyone! (\ud83c\udfba\ud83c\udfba noises) I\u2019m announcing my first ever feature contribution to Hack Club Bank. \ud83c\udf89 On your homepage, after logging in, you can now use the section called\"Feedback\"to ... well I think you can guess ... submit any ideas you have for cool new features on Bank! As always, you can still continue to reach out to us on theHack Club Slackor byemail.\n\nFew things are as essential to the banking experience as photo IDs. You always gotta wait for the teller to get a real good look at you, and your ID, before making a transaction. (after all, you wouldn't want your near-identical evil twin stealing your hard-earned money)\nThe Hack Club Bank experience should feel as good or better than a physical IRL bank. Now,you can sign in using just your face (or fingerprint), on supported devices & browsers.\n\nCurrently, this includes modern versions ofGoogle Chrome,Safari, andEdge(as well assomeversionsof Firefox), but you can check for support on your current deviceusing this nifty website.\nHave a Yubikey? Guess what: Bank supports hardware security keys too!\nTo get set up, head on down to the brand newSecurity Keyssection of your Bank settings. You'll be enjoying faster sign-ins in no time!\nI hate passwords. I can neverremember them when I need them, each new account I create means another'unique' password, andpeople are great at leaking them. Wereallydon't want to burden everyone with all that just to access their financial platform, so now it's even easier to login to Hack Club Bank without a password.\nI'm happy to announce thatyou can now get login codes for Hack Club Bank via SMS.The feature can be enabled fromyour settings page.\n\nUsers on iPhone and some Android phones can autofill their SMS login code.\nYou can now get your passwordless login code that much faster\u2013 reducing login on some devices down to under 10 seconds.\nThis post is to explain the background details of our switch to Stripe Issuing. Accounts that need action to make the switch will receive an email.\nEmburse cards have been a feature since one of the earliest versions of Hack Club Bank, allowing any team member to spend money with a debit card without dealing with reimbursements. While that\u2019s been amazing, there have been a few trade-offs with using Emburse:\nThese trade-offs made sense when we first started, but lots of details have changed in the last 2 years. Hack Club Bank has grown by\u2026I started doing the math on this, but the comparison is stupid\u2013our first year on Emburse has less than $1k spent per month, last week Bank users spent $20k through their cards. Emburse has been acquired (by a company that renamed to Emburse) & have shifted their product features.\nRecently Emburse announced they\u2019d be removing the card budgeting feature Bank currently relies on. If we stayed on Emburse the new flow would require organizers to request funds for a purchase, staff (Michael / Chaleb) to approve the purchase amount, then the card could make the transaction. Emburse was super gracious about the change, delaying the budget feature removal long enough for us to switch to another platform.\nThe card alternative we\u2019ve eyed for awhile is Stripe Issuing, but it was in private beta we couldn\u2019t access when we built Hack Club Bank. At the time of writing, we\u2019ve got a private version of Stripe Issuing cards running on Hack Club Bank (only available to admins) to make sure our new system works. I\u2019m happy to say it improves many of the previous issues with cards:\nThis is obviously a big change, and if you have any questions/comments please let us know either by reaching out to bank@hackclub.com or posting in the#bankchannel on Slack.\n4 major improvements to Bank live today:\nAll of this is live for everyone now. More to come! \ud83d\udc40\nThanks to our generous friends over at repl.it, in light of COVID-19,Hack Club Bank users get a free Hacker plan for the next year. Repl.it is an amazing web IDE, where you can get basically any programming language running in your web browser in just a few seconds\u2014regardless of what kind of computer you have. The Hacker plan, normally $84, gives you private projects, unlimited collaborators, & unlimited storage.

It\u2019s limited to the first 500 people who claim it, so don\u2019t wait.\nHope you\u2019re safe & well. If you have any questions, don\u2019t hesitate to reply & ask away!\nLast week, we launched a new feature in Hack Club Bank:Transparency Mode.\nWith Transparency Mode, you can open source your finances instantly from your account settings page. Why would you want to do that? Nonprofit donors deserve to know what their contributions are funding\u2014as a hackathon/nonprofit, you can talk about what you\u2019re spending money on, but transparency in every transaction builds trust for supporters. It\u2019s already live in action!\nThat\u2019s not all. When Hack Club first started, Zach\u2019s hope was to build a different kind of organization: one not only open source with code, but open source with its finances too. Every month, Zach would painstaking put every transactionon GitHub. Unfortunately, as we grew, the tooling took too long & we had to outsource our books to an accounting firm that didn\u2019t know what GitHub was.\nWe\u2019ll be sharing this publicly next week, but Bank users are getting a sneak peek today:Hack Club HQ has been running entirely on Bank for months now, and our finances are public. Dig in, right here:bank.hackclub.com/hq.\nLet\u2019s set a new standard in financial transparency for nonprofits. If you have any questions or feedback on how to improve Transparency Mode, please let us (bank@hackclub.com) know!\nToday, we\u2019re announcing withMajor League Hackingthat Hack Club Bank is the new preferred financial platform for allMLH Member Events.\nWith this announcement,Cal Hacks, the world\u2019s largest college hackathon, is announcing their switch to Hack Club Bank.Spectrais joining them as well.\nClick here to read Linus's full post on this announcement.\nBank can now predict the future! \ud83c\udf00\ud83c\udf89\nIf you want to know when your invoices are coming in, or how much money is going to be automatically withdrawn from your account, Bank will now tell you.\nCheck it out by clicking on either \"Incoming Deposits\" or \"Pending Withdrawals\" on your Bank dashboard.\nIf you've ever wanted to get that old, unpaid invoice off of your invoices page, you now can.\nCheck it out by clicking \"Archive\" when you're viewing an invoice. \ud83d\udea2\ud83c\udf89\nYou can now upload custom  profile pictures on Bank.\nCheck it out by navigating to the Team page and then selecting the settings icon next to your user. \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc4c\nHave you been stuck with a lame URL likehttps://bank.hackclub.com/hack-pennsylvaniaand have wanted to change it to something likehttps://bank.hackclub.com/hackpenn?\nWell, now you can!\nCheck it out in the your Bank's settings. \u2728 \u26a1\ufe0f\nWe've added a document to all projects that you can give to sponsors confirming that you're fiscally sponsored by Hack Club.\nCheck it out in your Documents tab! \u2728\u261d\ufe0f\nHave you ever wanted to attach an image or link to a transaction or invoice? Well, now with the addition ofMarkdown, you can.\nPower up your notes now! \ud83d\ude80\nStarting today, there's no longer a fee for accepting credit cards, bank transfers, or any other payment method.\nYou've invoiced Balsamiq for $500, they paid via credit card, but you only received $485.20. Where'd that $14.80 go? Welcome to the world of payment processing. (HC Bank usesStripe)\nPayment processing fees are annoying. Calculating them ahead of time is frustrating\u00a0and the result is alwayslessmoney\u00a0for your event, club, or project.\nStarting today, Hack Club Bank will make all your payment processing fees disappear.\nThis means that regardless of whether a sponsor is paying via credit card, ACH, or wire, when you send an invoice\u00a0for $500, you'll receive $500.\nAnd we're taking it even further.\nI'm proud to share\u00a0we're also reimbursing all previous payment processing fees, from all time, for everyone.\nDepending on the size of past invoices, you'll receive somewhere between $4.48\u00a0and\u00a0$390.50 (actual numbers) granted to your HC Bank\u00a0account this week.\nIf you want to read more, check out ourblog post with the full story.\nP.S.

Anyone, anywhere, can create beautiful things and solve real problems for people everywhere.\nLearning to code is your way into this world. Crossing this bridge unlocks the power to make stories, drawings, or wires into websites, games, robots, and things nobody but you imagine.\nIt\u2019s not about learning a programming framework\u2014it\u2019s about learning to teach yourself. Best of all, you can join a worldwide community of people doing the same. This is Hacker Culture, & it\u00a0brings out the best in us all.\nJust to be clear: we don\u2019t break in to internet banks. Some hackers specialize in cybersecurity; we\u2019re not especially focused on it.\nEvery day at Hack Camp you\u2019ll go home with a new finished project. We want some projects to be a surprise, but here are a few you\u2019ll certainly tackle:\nA teenager in our community built the website you\u2019re reading from scratch. The first day, it\u2019ll be your turn.\nRadios are the basis of Wi-Fi & satellites. You\u2019ll build one yourself\u2014but with a pencil, razor blade, & copper wire.\nMaking a game is a great intro to code, and it\u2019s never been easier.

I met an unbelievably accepting & kind community of creators & learners that introduced me to an entirely novel approach to hacking, changing not just the way I regard technology, but the way I approach the world at large.\nHack Camp attendee, 2016\nWe\u2019reHack Club, a global nonprofit network of high school coding clubs (now in 2% of US high schools). Hack Camp has been a part of Hack Club since the beginning. It\u2019s a great way for us to try out the best ideas from our community, develop curriculum, and stay sharp as teachers. We also just love doing it!\nFernanda is a student of computational neuroscience, entrepreneur, and organizer with years of experience running events and programs like the Entrepreneurial Learning Academy for students in Mexico. This summer, she\u2019ll run Hack Camp\u2019s logistics and be your primary contact.\nMingjie is a student organizer who has spread his passion for technology to thousands of other students through events like Hack Chicago, CodeDay, and his own Hack Club. This summer he\u2019s working with club leaders around the world to build the ultimate curriculum.\nChris is an all-around hacker enthusiast passionate about building video games, websites, radios, furniture, rockets, fire sculptures, communities, and more! He will be leading Hack Camp\u2019s workshops, designing hardware projects, and directing the day-to-day experience.\nHack Camp began as an experiment to discover new ways of teaching coding at our clubs around the world.\nAfter our first year, something incredible happened\u2014our students began running their own camps! They\u2019ve\u00a0sprung up in a suburb of Cincinnati & Southern India.\nThis was so inspiring to watch that we\u2019re following their lead to bring Hack Camp back in 2019.\n2015\nHack Club is born\n2015\nFirst Hack Camp in SF\n2016\nSF Hack Camp v2\n2017\nA Camp appears in Mason, OH\n2018\nCamp runs again in Mason\n2018\nA Camp appears in Kerala, India\n2019\nHack Camp returns to HQ!\nHack Camp is a chance for young students to discover their ability to build using code.

But when we got them started, they blew us away. They started learning by themselves during the camp and built things we never taught them.\nCamp leader, ASIET \u201921\nWe\u2019re\u00a0running Hack\u00a0Camp right at our office in San\u00a0Francisco (576 Natoma St).

Or will AI help tyrants surveil and manipulate us further? Are the main risks of AI from accidents, abuse by bad actors, or a rogue AIitselfbecoming a bad actor? Is this all just hype? Why can AI imitate any artist's style in a minute, yet gets confused drawing more than 3 objects? Why is it hard to make AI robustly serve humane values, or robustly serveanygoal?

Are we headed for utopia, dystopia, extinction, a fateworsethan extinction, or \u2014 the most shocking outcome of all \u2014nothing changes?Also: will an AI take my job?\n...and many more questions.\nAlas, to understand AI with nuance, we must understand lots of technical detail... but that detail is scattered across hundreds of articles, buried six-feet-deep in jargon.\nSo, I present to you:\n\nThis 3-part series is your one-stop-shop to understand the core ideas of AI & AI Safety* \u2014 explained in a friendly, accessible, and slightly opinionated way!\n(* Related phrases: AI Risk, AI X-Risk, AI Alignment, AI Ethics, AI Not-Kill-Everyone-ism.

For now: Logic is step-by-step cognition, like solving math problems. Intuition is all-at-oncerecognition, like seeing if a picture is of a cat. \"Intuition and Logic\" roughly map onto \"System 1 and 2\" from cognitive science.[1][2](\ud83d\udc48 hover over these footnotes! they expand!)\nAs you can tell by the \"scare\" \"quotes\" on\"versus\", these divisions ain't really so divided after all...\nHere's how these conflicts repeat over this 3-part series:\nSkipping over alotof detail, the history of AI is a tale ofLogic vs Intuition:\nBefore 2000: AI was all logic, no intuition.\nThis was why, in 1997, AI could beat the world champion at chess... yet no AIs could reliably recognize cats in pictures.[3]\n(Safety concern: Without intuition, AI can't understand common sense or humane values. Thus, AI might achieve goals in logically-correct but undesirable ways.)\nAfter 2000: AI could do \"intuition\", but had very poor logic.\nThis is why generative AIs (as of current writing, May 2024) can dream up whole landscapes in any artist's style...:yet gets confused drawing more than 3 objects.(\ud83d\udc48 click this text! it also expands!)\n(Safety concern: Without logic, we can't verify what's happening in an AI's \"intuition\". That intuition could be biased, subtly-but-dangerously wrong, or fail bizarrely in new scenarios.)\nCurrent Day: Westilldon't know how to unify logic & intuition in AI.\nBut if/when we do,thatwould give us the biggest risks & rewards of AI: something that can logically out-plan us,andlearn general intuition. That'd be an \"AI Einstein\"... or an \"AI Oppenheimer\".\nSummed in a picture:\n\nSo that's \"Logic vs Intuition\". As for the other core conflict, \"Problems in the AI vs The Humans\", that's one of the big controversies in the field of AI Safety: are our main risks from advanced AIitself, or fromhumansmisusing advanced AI?\n(Why not both?)\nTheproblem of AI Safety is this:[4]\nThe Value Alignment Problem:\u201cHow can we make AI robustly serve humane values?\u201d\nNOTE: I wrotehumane, with an \"e\", not just \"human\". Ahumanmay or may not behumane. I'm going to harp on this becausebothadvocates & critics of AI Safety keep mixing up the two.[5][6]\nWe can break this problem down by \"Problems in Humans vs AI\":\nHumane Values:\u201cWhatarehumane values, anyway?\u201d(a problem for philosophy & ethics)\nTheTechnicalAlignment Problem:\u201cHow can we make AI robustly serveany intended goalat all?\u201d(a problem for computer scientists - surprisingly, still unsolved!)\nThetechnicalalignment problem, in turn, can be broken down by \"Logic vs Intuition\":\nProblems with AI Logic:[7](\"game theory\" problems)\nProblems with AI Intuition:[8](\"deep learning\" problems)\n(Again, what \"logic\" and \"intuition\" are will be more precisely explained later!)\nSummed in a picture:\n\nAs intuition for how hard these problems are, note that we haven't even solved themfor us humans\u2014 People follow the letter of the law, not the spirit. People's intuition can be biased, and fail in new circumstances. And none of us are 100% the humane humans we wished we were.\nSo, if I may be a bit sappy, maybe understanding AI will help us understand ourselves. And just maybe, we can solve thehumanalignment problem: How do we gethumansto robustly serve humane values?\nFinally, we can understand some (possible) ways to solve the problems in logic, intuition, AIs,andhumans! These include:\n\u2014 and more! Experts disagree on which proposals will work, if any... but it's a good start.\n(Unfortunately, I can't give a layperson-friendly summary in this Intro, because these solutions won't make senseuntilyou understand the problems, which is what Part 1 & 2 are for. That said, if you want spoilers,:click here to see what Part 3 will cover!)\nHey, d'ya ever get this feeling?\nTo avoid that forthisguide, I've included someOPTIONALinteractive flashcards! They use \"Spaced Repetition\", an easy-ish, evidence-backed way to \"make long-term memory a choice\". (:click here to learn more about Spaced Repetition!)\nHere:try the below flashcards, to retain what you just learnt!\n(There's an optional sign-up at the end,ifyou want to save these cards for long-term study. Note:I do not own or control this app, it's third-party. If you'd rather use the open source flashcard appAnki,here'sa downloadable Anki deck!)\n(Also, you don't need to memorize the answersexactly, just the gist. You be the judge if you got it \"close enough\".)\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t what you don\u2019t know that gets you into trouble.\nIt\u2019s what you know for sure that just ain\u2019t so.\u201d\n~ often attributed to Mark Twain, but it just ain't so[9]\nFor better and worse, you've already heard too much about AI. So before we connectnewpuzzle pieces in your mind, we gotta take out theoldpieces that just ain't so.\nThus, if you'll indulge me in a \"Top 5\" listicle...\n\nAI Safety / AI Risk used to be less mainstream, but now in 2024, the US & UK governments now have AI Safety-specific departments![10]This resulted from many ofthetop AI researchers raising alarm bells about it. These folks include:\n(To be clear: therearealso top AI researchersagainstfears of AI Risk, such Yann LeCun,[16]co-winner of the 2018 Turing Prize, and chief AI researcher atFacebookMeta. Another notable name is Melanie Mitchell[17], a researcher in AI & complexity science.)\nI'm aware \"look at these experts\" is an appeal to authority, but this isonlyto counter the idea of, \"eh, only sci-fi weebs fear AI Risk\". But in the end, appeal to authority/weebs isn't enough; you have toactually understand the dang thing. (Which youaredoing, by reading this! So thank you.)\nBut speaking of sci-fi weebs...\nSci-fi authors write sentient AIs because they're writingstories, not technical papers. The philosophical debate on artificial consciousness is fascinating,and irrelevant to AI Safety.Analogy: a nuclear bomb isn't conscious, but it can still be unsafe, no?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the real problems in AI Safety are \"boring\": an AI learns the wrong things from its biased training data, it breaks in slightly-new scenarios, it logically accomplishes goals in undesired ways, etc.\nBut, \"boring\" doesn't meannot important. The technical details of how to design a safe elevator/airplane/bridge are boring to most laypeople...and alsoa matter of life-and-death.\n(Catastrophic AI Risk doesn't even require \"super-human general intelligence\"! For example, an AI that's \"only\" good at designing viruses could help a bio-terrorist organization (like Aum Shinrikyo[18]) kill millions of people.)\nBut speaking of killing people...\n\nWhile most AI researchersdobelieve advanced AI poses a 5+% risk of \"literally everybody dies\"[19], it'sveryhard to convince folks (especially policymakers) of stuff that's never happened before.\nSo instead, I'd like to highlight the ways that advanced AI \u2013 (especially when it's available to anyone with a high-end computer) \u2013 could lead to catastrophes, \"merely\" by scaling upalready-existingbad stuff.\nFor example:\nThe above examples are all \"humansmisuseAI to cause havoc\", but remember advanced AI could do the aboveby itself, due to \"boring\" reasons: it's accomplishing a goal in a logical-but-undesirable way, its goals glitch out but its skills remain intact, etc.\n(Bonus,:Some concrete, plausible ways a rogue AI could \"escape containment\", or affect the physical world.)\nPoint is: even if one doesn't think AI is aliteral 100% human extinctionrisk... I'd say \"homebrew bio-terrorism\" & \"1984 with robots\" are still worth taking seriously.\nOn the flipside...\n\nAI Risk folks aren't Luddites. In fact, they warn about AI's downsidesprecisely becausethey care about AI's upsides.[30]As humorist Gil Stern once said:[31]\n\u201cBoth the optimist and the pessimist contribute to society: the optimist invents the airplane, and the pessimist invents the parachute.\u201d\nSo: even as this series goes into detail on how AIis alreadygoing wrong, it's worth remembering the few ways AIis alreadygoing right:\nToo often, we take technology \u2014 even life-saving technology \u2014 for granted. So, let me zoom out for context. Here's the last 2000+ years of child mortality, the percentage of kids who die before puberty:\n(fromDattani, Spooner, Ritchie and Roser (2023))\nForthousandsof years, in nations both rich and poor, a fullhalfof kids just died. This was a constant. Then, starting in the 1800s \u2014 thanks to science/tech like germ theory, sanitation, medicine, clean water, vaccines, etc \u2014 child mortality fell off like a cliff. We still have far more to go \u2014 I refuse to accept[33]a worldwide 4.3% (1 in 23) child death rate \u2014 but let's just appreciate how humanityso swiftly cut downaneons-oldscourge.\nHow did we achieve this? Policy's a big part of the story, but policy is \"the art of the possible\"[34], and the above wouldn't have been possible withoutgoodscience & tech. If safe, humane AI can help us progress further by even just a few percent \u2014 towards slaying the remaining dragons of cancer, Alzheimer's, HIV/AIDS, etc \u2014 that'd be tens of millions more of our loved ones, who get to beat the Reaper for another day.\nF#@\u2606 going to Mars,that'swhy advanced AI matters.\n. . .\nWait,really?Toys like ChatGPT and DALL-E arelife-and-deathstakes? That leads us to the final misconception I'd like to address:\nOh come on,one might reasonably retort,AI can't consistently draw more than 3 objects. How's it going to take over the world? Heck, how's it even going to take my job?\nI present to you, arelevant xkcd:\n\nThis is how I feel about \"don't worry about AI, it can't even do [X]\".\nIs our postmodern memory-spanthatbad?Onedecade ago, justone, the world's state-of-the-art AIs couldn't reliablyrecognize pictures of cats.Now, notonlycan AI do that at human-performance level, AIs can pump out:a picture of a cat-ninja slicing a watermelon in the style of Vincent Van Goghinunder a minute.\nIscurrentAI a huge threat to our jobs, or safety? No. (Well, besides the aforementioned deepfake scams.)\nBut: if AI keeps improving at a similar rate as it has for the last decade... it seems plausible to me we could get \"Einstein/Oppenheimer-level\" AI in 30 years.[35]That's well within many folks' lifetimes!\nAs \"they\" say:[36]\nThe best time to plant a tree was 30 years ago. The second best time is today.\nLet's plant that tree today!\n(To review the flashcards, click theTable of Contents icon in the right sidebar, then click the \"\ud83e\udd14 Review\" links.

When I have a tangent that doesn't fit the main flow, I'll shove it into an \"expandable\" section like this one! (They'll be links withdottedunderlines, not solid underlines.)\nAnyway, here's a prompt to draw four objects:\n\u201cA yellow pyramid between a red sphere and green cylinder, all on top of a big blue cube.\u201d\nHere are the top generative AI's first four attempts (notcherry-picked):\nMidjourney:\n\nDALL-E 2:\n\nDALL-E 3:\n\n(The bottom-right one's pretty close! But judging by its other attempts, it's clearly luck.)\nWhy does this demonstrate a lack of \"logic\" in AI? A core part of \"symbolic logic\" is the ability to do \"compositionality\", a fancy way of saying it can reliably combine old things into new things, like \"green\" + \"cylinder\" = \"green cylinder\". As shown above, generative AIs (as of May 2024) areveryunreliable at combining stuff, when there's more than 3 objects.\n~ ~ ~\nAnyway, that's the end of this Nutshell!

But I'm putting this here now, for:\na) The layperson audience, to reassure y'all that, yes, therearemany promising proposed solutions.\nb) The expert audience, to reassure y'all that, yes, I probably have your niche lil' thing in here.\nAnyway, the TOP 10 TYPES-OF-SOLUTIONS to AI Safety: (with the fancy jargon in parentheses)\n\u201cUse it, or lose it.\u201d\nThat's the core principle behind both muscles and brains. (It rhymes, so it must be true!) As decades of educational research robustly show (Dunlosky et al., 2013 [pdf]), if you want to retain something long-term, it's not enough to re-read or highlight stuff: you have to actuallytest yourself.\nThat's why flashcards work so well! But, two problems: 1) It's overwhelming when you havehundredsof cards you want to remember. And 2) It's inefficient to review cards youalreadyknow well.\nSpaced Repetitionsolves both these problems! To see how, let's see what happens if you learn a fact, thendon'treview it. Your memory of it decays over time, until you cross a threshold where you've likely forgotten it:\n\nBut, if you review a factjust beforeyou forget it, you can get your memory-strength back up...and more importantly, your memory of that fact will decayslower!\n\nSo, with Spaced Repetition, we review right before you're predicted to forget a card, over and over. As you can see, the reviews get more and more spread out:\n\nThis is what makes Spaced Repetition so efficient!Every time you successfully review a card, the interval to your next reviewmultiplies.For example, let's say our multiplier is 2x. So you review a card on Day 1, then Day 2, then Day4, Day 8, 16, 32, 64... until, with justfifteen reviews, you can remember a card for 215= 32,768 days =ninety years. (In theory. In practice it's less, but still super efficient!)\nAnd that's just foronecard. Thanks to the exponentially-growing gaps, you can add 10 new cards a day (the recommended amount), to long-term retain3650 cardsa year... withless than 20 minutes of reviewa day. (For context, 3000+ cards is enough to master basic vocabulary for a new language! In one year, with just 20 minutes a day!)\nSpaced Repetition is one ofthemost evidence-backed ways to learn (Kang 2016 [pdf]). But outside of language-learning communities & med school, it isn't very well-known...yet.\nSo: how canyouget started with Spaced Repetition?\nFor more info on spaced repetition, check out these videos byAli Abdaal (26 min)andThomas Frank (8 min).\nAndthat'show you can make long-term memory a choice!\nHappy learning! \ud83d\udc4d\nWays an AI could \"escape containment\":\nWays an AI could affect the physical world:\nTwo months ago [March 2024], avolunteer, off-the-clockdeveloper found a malicious backdoor in a major piece of code... which wasthree yearsin the making,mere weeks awayfrom going live, and would've attacked the vast majority of internet servers... and this volunteer only caught itby accident, when he noticed that his code was runninghalf a second too slow.\nThis was the XZ Utils Backdoor.
